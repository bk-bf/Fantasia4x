## **Development Principles Throughout**

**Always Testable**
- Each milestone produces a playable build
- Focus on visible, interactive features first
- Implement placeholder systems that can be expanded later[3]

**UI/UX Priority**
- Every system gets a proper interface before moving on
- Test usability with each addition
- Maintain consistent visual design language

**Incremental Complexity**
- Start with simple versions of complex systems
- Add depth through iteration, not initial implementation
- Ensure each phase builds naturally on the previous

**Feedback Loops**
- Every player action should have visible consequences
- Implement satisfying progression indicators
- Create clear cause-and-effect relationships

This roadmap ensures you always have a playable, testable version of Fantasia4x while building toward the complex Aurora-inspired depth you're aiming for. Each phase delivers immediate value while setting up the foundation for the next level of complexity.
