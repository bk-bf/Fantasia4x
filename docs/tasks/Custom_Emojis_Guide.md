Looking at the search results and your roadmap's emphasis on "unique visual identity" and "polished presentation," absolutely! You can definitely convert PNG images to custom emojis for your game. This would create a much more original and cohesive visual experience compared to standard Unicode emojis.

## Best Approaches for Your Game

```
