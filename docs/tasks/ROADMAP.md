- ⚠️ **Event System**: Message log is visually unpolished, cannot be unhidden once hidden, and currently does not display any messages due to a bug
- ⚠️ **System Integration**: Manual mapping between abilities/buildings/items/research creating tedious maintenance
- ⚠️ **Pawn Behavior**: Pawns track needs but don't act on them (no eating/sleeping behavior), no consequences for unfulfilled needs

## 📅 **Phase 1: Foundation Stabilization (Week 1-3)**
*Goal: Simplify content and architecture for a stable base.*

- **Week 1:** Reduce databases to minimal debug entries (5-10 per type), archive full content, update references, verify core loops, and document removals.
- **Week 2:** Map data flow, document dependencies, design clean integration interfaces, and plan state management.
- **Week 3:** Refactor pawn system (reduce abilities, add basic needs/behavior), automate modifiers, standardize state management, and fix integration.

### **Week 1: Content Simplification & System Reduction**

*Strategic Refactoring & Foundation-First Development Plan*

## 🎯 **Current State Analysis**
Fantasia4x has evolved from a 4X strategy game into a text-based colony simulation with deep, complex systems. This evolution is positive but has led to technical debt and architectural strain, especially from excessive abilities, complex databases, and premature system integration.

## 📅 **COMPLETED SYSTEMS**
- **Core Foundation**: Race generation, unified resource management, building, population, research, crafting, work assignment, exploration, event, inventory, and equipment systems are implemented and stable.
- **Critical Issues**: 100+ abilities (maintenance nightmare), over-complex content databases, system integration conflicts, visual bugs, and incomplete pawn behavior.

## 🚦 **Mandatory Phase Gates & Success Metrics**
- **Phase 1:** Minimal content, stable core, clean architecture.
- **Phase 2:** No backend errors, polished UI, stable features.
- **Phase 3:** Handles expanded content, integrated combat, 10+ hours gameplay.
- **Phase 4:** Ready for release, full content, accessible, moddable.

## 🌟 **Core Principles**
- **Architecture-first:** Every feature must fit cleanly.
- **Incremental complexity:** Add/test one feature at a time.
- **Integration validation:** Maintain clear interfaces.
- **Content discipline:** Resist complexity until proven.
- **Strict phase gates:** Do not proceed with unresolved issues.

**Key Insight:** Simple, reliable systems are more valuable than complex, fragile ones. Discipline in early phases enables rapid, confident expansion later.
