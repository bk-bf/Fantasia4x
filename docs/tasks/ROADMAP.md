## üîß **Database Development Principles**

### **Schema First, Data Later**
```
- [] Week 1: Design race schema ‚Üí Test empty database
- [] Week 2: Implement race logic ‚Üí Test with minimal data
- [] Week 3: Populate full database ‚Üí Test with complete dataset
```

### **Incremental Population**
```
- [] Phase 1: 8 buildings, 50 traits, 30 events
- [] Phase 2: 15 tools, 25 jobs, 50 events  
- [] Phase 3: 25 hero abilities, 50 locations
- [] Phase 4: 100+ events, complete faction data
```

### **Continuous Testing**
- [] Test database schema before logic implementation
- [] Test logic with minimal data before full population
- [] Test full system after database population
- [] Verify performance with realistic data volumes

### **Technical Debt Prevention**
- [] No hardcoded game data beyond initial prototypes
- [] All game content stored in properly designed databases
- [] Database migrations planned for schema changes
- [] Regular database performance monitoring

This approach ensures proper database architecture from the start while maintaining the ability to test and iterate on game logic before committing to large datasets.
