# üéÆ Fantasia4x Core Gameplay Loop Document v3.0

## üåü Overview

Fantasia4x is a **text-based colony simulation** with **emergent tactical combat** and **discovery-driven research**. Unlike traditional 4X games with repetitive early phases, every element from race generation to combat encounters creates unique strategic paths from Turn 1, evolving into a deep tactical experience that maintains text-based accessibility while offering Battle Brothers-style combat depth.

## üé≤ Game Start: Procedural Race Foundation

### **Race Generation System (Current Implementation)**
```
1. Generate Stat Ranges (Per Stat):
   - Base range: 8-15 with random variation
   - 30% chance of specialization per stat:
     * High specialization: +2 to +3 bonus to range
     * Low specialization: -2 penalty to range
   - Final ranges typically: 6-18 per stat

2. Generate Physical Traits:
   - Size: tiny/small/medium/large/huge (affects height/weight ranges)
   - Height variation: ¬±15-35cm from base
   - Weight variation: ¬±10-30kg from base

3. Generate 2-4 Racial Traits:
   - Selected from 25+ comprehensive traits
   - Conflict prevention (e.g., Flame Touched ‚â† Frost Born)
   - Wide variety: Physical, Elemental, Mystical, Social, Exotic

4. Generate Cultural Implications:
   - Knowledge traditions (e.g., "Crystal archives store memories")
   - Food customs (e.g., "Mushroom farms in dark caverns")
   - Combat practices (e.g., "Ritual scarification for battle")
   - Diplomatic methods (e.g., "Speaking in harmonic tones")
```

### **Individual Pawn Generation**
```
When Population Grows:
1. Roll each stat within race's stat ranges
2. Apply racial trait stat bonuses/penalties
3. Roll physical traits within race's physical ranges
4. Initialize needs (hunger/fatigue/sleep) based on constitution
5. Create equipment slots and shared inventory access
6. Calculate 50+ abilities from stats + traits + equipment
```

### **Immediate Strategic Impact**
- **Specialist Races**: Extreme stat ranges (6-8 in weak areas, 15-18 in strong)
- **Balanced Races**: Consistent 10-13 ranges across all stats
- **Trait-Driven Races**: Average stats but powerful racial abilities
- **Adaptive Races**: Moderate stats with flexible trait combinations

**Example Race Variations:**
```
Race A: "Crystalline-Eyed Stargazers"
‚Üí Stat Ranges: Str 6-9, Dex 8-12, Int 15-18, Wis 13-16, Cha 9-12, Con 7-10
‚Üí Traits: Crystalline Eyes (+2 Wis, +1 Int), Stargazer (+3 Wis, +1 Int)
‚Üí Strategy: Research powerhouse, physically vulnerable

Race B: "Iron-Skinned Berserkers"  
‚Üí Stat Ranges: Str 14-17, Dex 10-13, Int 6-9, Wis 8-11, Cha 7-10, Con 15-18
‚Üí Traits: Iron Skin (+3 Con), Berserker Blood (+3 Str, +1 Con)
‚Üí Strategy: Combat-focused, research struggles

Race C: "Industrious Generalists"
‚Üí Stat Ranges: Str 9-12, Dex 10-13, Int 10-13, Wis 11-14, Cha 9-12, Con 10-13
‚Üí Traits: Industrious (+15% work efficiency), Curious (+2 Int, +1 Wis)
‚Üí Strategy: Balanced, steady progression
```

## üë• Population & Colony Evolution

### **Population Growth & Pawn System**
```
Starting Population: 1 
Growth Rate: Dynamic, influenced by key events (e.g., discoveries, crises, celebrations), available colony infrastructure (housing, nurseries, medical facilities), and critical resources/items (food surplus, rare fertility boosters, cultural artifacts). Population growth accelerates or slows in response to these factors rather than following a fixed curve.
Pawn Generation: Each new pawn rolls within race stat ranges + trait bonuses
Individual Variation: Each pawn unique within racial parameters
```

### **Simplified Ability System (15 Core Categories)**
```
Work Efficiencies (Auto-calculated from stats + traits + equipment):
- Mining, Woodcutting, Crafting, Research, Construction
- Hunting, Fishing, Foraging (food production)

Basic Survival (50+ abilities tracked):
- Health Regeneration, Disease Resistance, Elemental Resistances
- Carry Capacity, Movement Speed, Environmental Adaptations

Social/Mental:
- Learning Speed, Social Influence, Research Speed
- Knowledge Storage, Memory Bonus, Experience Gain

Combat (Equipment-driven abilities):
- Base Combat Power, Defense (detailed abilities from equipment)
- Combat special abilities from racial traits

Physical Traits:
- Night Vision, Danger Sense, Tremor Sense
- Swimming Speed, Size Modifiers, Environmental Senses

Special Abilities (Trait-dependent):
- Telepathy, Shapeshifting, Elemental Powers
- Unique racial capabilities
```

### **Needs & Behavior System**
```
Automatic Needs Tracking:
- Hunger (0-100): Auto-eat when critical (90+)
- Sleep (0-100): Auto-sleep when exhausted (95+)  
- Fatigue (0-100): Auto-rest when tired (80+)
- Morale (0-100): Affects all work efficiency

Behavioral Responses:
- Critical needs override work assignments
- Low morale (20) = work refusal events
- Very low morale (10) = mental breakdown (5 turns)
- Constitution affects hunger/fatigue rates
- Racial traits modify need fulfillment efficiency
```

- "Ancient" + research focus = wise elder civilization preserving knowledge
```

### **Dynamic Racial Identity**
```
Population Growth Effects:

- Combat experiences influence warrior culture development
- Trade relationships affect diplomatic trait expression
- Crisis events strengthen or weaken certain cultural aspects
```

## üåü Design Philosophy: Emergent Racial Storytelling

**üéØ Core Principle**: Every race combination creates a unique civilization with distinct strengths, weaknesses, and cultural identity that emerges through gameplay rather than predetermined paths.

**üîÑ Adaptive Complexity**: 
- Simple race generation rules create complex strategic variety
- Racial traits interact with game systems to produce emergent strategies
- No "correct" way to play any race - adaptation and creativity rewarded
- System mastery comes from understanding racial synergies

**üé≤ Procedural Identity**: 
- Race generation creates immediate strategic constraints and opportunities
- Cultural implications provide narrative flavor for player imagination
- Trait combinations suggest unique civilization personalities
- Population evolution allows civilizations to grow and change over time

*üåü "Every race tells a different story, every trait combination opens new strategic paths, every civilization develops its own unique identity through the choices and challenges it faces." üåü*
