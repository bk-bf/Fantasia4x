*Comprehensive Combat System Design for Fantasia4x*

## üéØ **Executive Summary**

This document outlines the complete combat system design for Fantasia4x, implementing a **Battle Brothers-inspired tactical combat system** with **Caves of Qud-style graphics evolution**. The system balances realistic large-scale combat (20-50 pawns) with manageable tactical complexity through a hybrid ASCII-to-graphics approach.

**Core Philosophy**: Maintain text-based accessibility while providing tactical depth that integrates seamlessly with the colony simulation systems.

## üèóÔ∏è **System Architecture Overview**

### **Combat System Foundation**
- **Turn-based tactical combat** with initiative-based action order
- **Action Point (AP) system** for movement and abilities
- **Position-based mechanics** with formation importance
- **Equipment-driven abilities** tied to existing item system
- **Permadeath consequences** affecting colony workforce

### **Scale Management Strategy**
- **Elite pawn focus**: Full tactical control for 20-50 combat-capable pawns
- **Realistic scarcity**: Combat-capable pawns are rare and valuable
- **Meaningful consequences**: Injuries, PTSD, equipment loss affect entire colony
- **Hierarchical command**: Squad-based organization for large battles

## üìä **Combat Mechanics Specification**

### **Initiative & Turn Order System**
```
Turn Order Calculation:
Base Initiative = Pawn Speed Stat (50-150)
+ Equipment Modifiers (Light armor +10, Heavy armor -20)
+ Status Effects (Wounded -30, Stimmed +20)
+ Random Factor (1d20)

Example Turn Order:
1. Aria (Archer) - Initiative 142
2. Bandit Scout - Initiative 135  
3. Marcus (Warrior) - Initiative 118
4. Bandit Leader - Initiative 95
```

### **Action Point System**
Each pawn receives **Action Points (AP)** per turn based on their stats:

| Action Type | AP Cost | Notes |
|-------------|---------|-------|
| Move 1 Tile | 1 AP | Basic movement |
| Basic Attack | 2-3 AP | Varies by weapon |
| Special Ability | 3-5 AP | Equipment/skill dependent |
| Defend/Wait | 1 AP | Gain defensive bonuses |
| Use Item | 2 AP | Healing, buffs, etc. |

**AP Calculation**: `Base AP = 6 + (Speed/20) + Equipment Modifiers`

### **Positioning & Formation System**

#### **ASCII Battlefield Grid**
```
Battlefield Layout (12x8 grid):
    A B C D E F G H I J K L
 1  . . . # # . . . . . . .
 2  . @ @ # # . . E E . . .
 3  . @ @ . . . . E . . . .
 4  . . . ~ ~ ~ . . . . . .
 5  . . . ~ ~ ~ . E . . . .
 6  . . . . . . . . . . . .
 7  . . . . . . . . . . . .
 8  . . . . . . . . . . . .

Legend:
@ = Your pawns    E = Enemies    # = Trees (Cover)
~ = Water (Impassable)    . = Open ground
```

#### **Formation Mechanics**
- **Front Line**: +10% damage, -10% defense
- **Back Line**: +10% defense, -10% damage, ranged weapon bonus
- **Flanking**: +20% damage when attacking from sides/rear
- **Cover**: Trees/rocks provide +15% defense against ranged attacks

### **Combat Abilities System**

#### **Equipment-Based Abilities**
Abilities are determined by equipped weapons and tools:

**Melee Weapons:**
- **Swords**: Slash (2 AP), Riposte (3 AP), Lunge (4 AP)
- **Axes**: Cleave (3 AP), Shield Splitter (4 AP), Overhead Strike (3 AP)
- **Spears**: Thrust (2 AP), Spearwall (4 AP), Reach Attack (3 AP)
- **Maces**: Bash (2 AP), Stun Strike (4 AP), Armor Breaker (3 AP)

**Ranged Weapons:**
- **Bows**: Quick Shot (2 AP), Aimed Shot (4 AP), Multi-Shot (5 AP)
- **Crossbows**: Bolt Shot (3 AP), Piercing Shot (4 AP), Reload (2 AP)
- **Throwing**: Quick Throw (2 AP), Aimed Throw (3 AP)

#### **Pawn Skill Integration**
Combat effectiveness modified by existing pawn abilities:
- **Combat Skill**: +5% hit chance per 10 skill points
- **Athletics**: +1 AP per 20 skill points
- **Tactics**: +10% damage when leading a squad
- **Medicine**: Can use healing abilities in combat

## ü§ñ **Enemy AI System**

### **Behavior-Based AI Architecture**
Simple but effective AI behaviors that create tactical challenges:

#### **AI Personality Types**
1. **Aggressive**: Always moves toward nearest enemy, prioritizes damage
2. **Defensive**: Maintains formation, attacks when approached
3. **Opportunist**: Targets weakest/isolated pawns, uses terrain
4. **Support**: Buffs allies, avoids direct combat, heals wounded
5. **Tactical**: Uses abilities strategically, coordinates with allies

#### **AI Decision Tree**
```
AI Turn Logic:
1. Check for critical threats (low health, surrounded)
2. Evaluate available targets (distance, weakness, tactical value)
3. Consider positioning (cover, flanking opportunities)
4. Select action based on personality type
5. Execute with random variation (10-20% chance of suboptimal choice)
```

### **Difficulty Scaling**
- **Easy**: Simple AI, fewer enemies, better equipment for player
- **Normal**: Standard AI behaviors, balanced encounters
- **Hard**: Enhanced AI coordination, more enemies, limited player resources
- **Nightmare**: Perfect AI coordination, overwhelming numbers, equipment scarcity

## üé® **Visual Evolution: ASCII to Graphics**

### **Phase 1: Enhanced ASCII (Immediate Implementation)**
```
Current ASCII Representation:
@ = Pawn (with health bar: @[‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñì‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë])
E = Enemy (with type indicator: E‚ÇÅ, E‚ÇÇ, E‚ÇÉ)
# = Cover (with height: #‚ÇÅ, #‚ÇÇ, #‚ÇÉ)
~ = Terrain (with effect: ~slow, ~block, ~burn)

Enhanced ASCII Features:
- Color coding for pawn status (green=healthy, yellow=wounded, red=critical)
- Animation frames for attacks (@ ‚Üí ‚öî ‚Üí @)
- Status effect indicators (@*stunned*, @+buffed+, @-debuffed-)
```

### **Phase 2: Caves of Qud-Style Sprites (Future)**
```
Sprite System Architecture:
- 32x32 pixel tiles for optimal readability
- Layered rendering: Background ‚Üí Terrain ‚Üí Units ‚Üí Effects ‚Üí UI
- Animation frames: Idle, Move, Attack, Defend, Death
- Equipment visualization: Weapons and armor visible on sprites
- Status overlays: Health bars, status effects, action indicators
```

#### **Asset Requirements**
- **Pawn Sprites**: 20+ variations based on race and equipment
- **Enemy Sprites**: 15+ enemy types with attack animations
- **Terrain Tiles**: 30+ environmental elements
