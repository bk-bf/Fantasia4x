# Service Integration Architecture Design

## Overview

This document defines the complete service integration architecture for Fantasia4x, detailing how the GameEngine coordinates with the service layer, manages service lifecycles, and facilitates communication between services.

## Architecture Components

### 1. ServiceRegistry Interface

The ServiceRegistry serves as the central access point for all game services, providing:

- **Service Access**: Type-safe access to all registered services
- **Lifecycle Management**: Initialization, shutdown, and restart capabilities
- **Health Monitoring**: Service status tracking and health checks
- **Communication**: Inter-service messaging and broadcasting

```typescript
interface ServiceRegistry {
    // Core service access
    itemService: ItemService;
    buildingService: BuildingService;
    workService: WorkService;
    researchService: ResearchService;
    pawnService: PawnService;
    eventService: EventService;
    
    // Management operations
    isInitialized(): boolean;
    getServiceStatus(serviceName: string): ServiceStatus;
    initializeServices(gameState: GameState): Promise<ServiceInitializationResult>;
    shutdownServices(): Promise<void>;
    restartService(serviceName: string): Promise<boolean>;
}
```

### 2. GameEngine Service Injection

The GameEngine integrates with services through a clean injection pattern:

#### Injection Process
1. **Service Creation**: ServiceRegistry creates all services with proper dependencies
2. **Validation**: Dependency graph validation ensures no circular dependencies
3. **Initialization**: Services are initialized in dependency order
4. **Integration**: GameEngine receives the complete ServiceRegistry
5. **Coordination**: GameEngine coordinates all service interactions

#### GameEngine Integration Points
```typescript
interface GameEngine {
    // Service integration
    integrateServices(services: ServiceRegistry): void;
    getServices(): ServiceRegistry;
    
    // Coordinated operations
    coordinateSystemInteractions(
        sourceSystem: string,
        targetSystem: string,
        interactionType: 'query' | 'command' | 'event',
        data: any
    ): SystemInteractionResult;
}
```

### 3. Service Communication Patterns

#### Direct Service Access
- GameEngine provides direct access to services for simple operations
- Type-safe service method calls through ServiceRegistry
- Immediate execution for synchronous operations

#### Coordinated Multi-Service Operations
- Complex operations requiring multiple services
- Dependency-ordered execution
- Transaction-like behavior with rollback capabilities
- Performance optimization through batching

#### Event-Driven Communication
- Services can broadcast events to other services
- GameEngine mediates event distribution
- Asynchronous event processing
- Event history for debugging and auditing

## Service Lifecycle Management

### Initialization Strategy

#### Phase 1: Dependency Resolution
1. **Service Registration**: All services registered with their dependencies
2. **Dependency Validation**: Check for circular dependencies and missing services
3. **Topological Sort**: Determine initialization order based on dependencies
4. **Dependency Injection**: Create service instances with resolved dependencies

#### Phase 2: Service Initialization
1. **Sequential Initialization**: Initialize services in dependency order
2. **Health Checks**: Verify each service initializes correctly
3. **Error Handling**: Handle initialization failures gracefully
4. **Status Tracking**: Update service status throughout initialization

#### Phase 3: GameEngine Integration
1. **Service Injection**: Inject complete ServiceRegistry into GameEngine
2. **Integration Validation**: Verify all services are accessible
3. **System Readiness**: Confirm entire system is ready for operation

### Shutdown Strategy

#### Graceful Shutdown Process
1. **Shutdown Signal**: Broadcast shutdown message to all services
2. **Reverse Order**: Shutdown services in reverse dependency order
3. **Resource Cleanup**: Each service cleans up its resources
4. **Status Updates**: Track shutdown progress and handle failures
5. **Final Cleanup**: GameEngine performs final cleanup

### Health Monitoring

#### Continuous Health Checks
- **Periodic Checks**: Regular health checks for all services
- **Failure Detection**: Identify unhealthy or failed services
- **Automatic Recovery**: Restart failed services when possible
- **Status Reporting**: Provide detailed health status information

#### Health Check Implementation
```typescript
interface ServiceStatus {
    name: string;
    isInitialized: boolean;
    isHealthy: boolean;
    lastError?: string;
    dependencies: string[];
    dependents: string[];
    initializationTime?: number;
    lastHealthCheck?: number;
}
```

## Dependency Injection Strategy

### Service Container Design

#### Registration Pattern
```typescript
// Register services with their dependencies
container.register('itemService', () => new ItemServiceImpl(), []);
container.register('buildingService', 
    (deps) => new BuildingServiceImpl(deps.itemService), 
    ['itemService']
);
```

#### Resolution Strategy
1. **Singleton Pattern**: Services are created once and reused
2. **Lazy Loading**: Services created only when first accessed
3. **Dependency Resolution**: Automatically resolve and inject dependencies
4. **Circular Detection**: Prevent circular dependency issues

### Dependency Graph Management

#### Validation Process
1. **Graph Construction**: Build dependency graph from registrations
2. **Cycle Detection**: Use DFS to detect circular dependencies
3. **Missing Dependencies**: Identify unregistered dependencies
4. **Topological Sort**: Determine valid initialization order

#### Error Handling
- **Circular Dependencies**: Clear error messages with dependency chain
- **Missing Dependencies**: List all missing services
- **Resolution Failures**: Detailed error information for debugging

## Service Communication Coordination

### Message-Based Communication

#### Message Types
- **State Updates**: Notify services of state changes
- **Calculation Requests**: Request calculations from other services
- **Validation Requests**: Validate operations across services
- **Event Notifications**: Broadcast game events
- **Health Checks**: Service health monitoring

#### Message Flow
1. **Message Creation**: Service creates message with type and data
2. **GameEngine Mediation**: GameEngine routes message to target service
3. **Handler Execution**: Target service processes message
4. **Response Handling**: Return results to requesting service
5. **History Tracking**: Log messages for debugging

### Coordinated Operations

#### Multi-Service Operations
```typescript
// Example: Crafting an item requires multiple services
const operations = [
    { serviceName: 'itemService', operation: 'getItem', params: [itemId] },
    { serviceName: 'pawnService', operation: 'getPawn', params: [pawnId] },
    { serviceName: 'workService', operation: 'calculateEfficiency', params: [pawnId, 'crafting'] }
];

const result = await gameEngine.coordinateMultiServiceOperation(operations);
```

#### Transaction-Like Behavior
- **Atomic Operations**: All operations succeed or all fail
- **Rollback Capability**: Undo changes if any operation fails
- **Consistency Guarantees**: Maintain system consistency across operations
