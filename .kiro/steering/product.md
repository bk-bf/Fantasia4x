# Fantasia4x Product Overview

Fantasia4x is a **mechanics-first**, **beginner-friendly** 4X strategy game that emphasizes **procedural generation** and **immersive storytelling**. The core innovation is solving the "early game variety challenge" - making every playthrough feel different from turn 1, not just after hours of identical setup.

## Core Philosophy
- **Procedural Everything**: Races, traits, events, and discoveries are dynamically generated
- **Immediate Strategic Impact**: Generated content affects gameplay mechanics from the first turn
- **Beginner-Friendly**: Clean, intuitive interfaces without overwhelming complexity
- **Event-Driven Gameplay**: Discovery through dynamic events rather than manual exploration
- **Mechanics Over Graphics**: Solid gameplay systems before visual polish

## Current Development Status
**⚠️ CRITICAL: The project is currently in architectural refactoring phase due to premature complexity syndrome.**

### Completed Systems
- ✅ **Procedural Race Generation**: Unique stats, traits, and characteristics
- ✅ **Building & Construction System**: Time-based construction with resource management
- ✅ **Research System**: Knowledge-based progression using scrolls and materials
- ✅ **Work Assignment System**: Pawns with individual needs, skills, and work assignments
- ✅ **Event System**: Dynamic storytelling through procedural events
- ✅ **Crafting & Tool System**: 20+ tools across 4 tech levels
- ✅ **Exploration System**: Location discovery through missions
- ✅ **Inventory & Equipment**: Unified inventory with equipment effects

### Systems Requiring Critical Refactoring
- ⚠️ **Missing GameEngine**: No central coordinator for system interactions
- ⚠️ **Circular Dependencies**: Pawns → Items → Work → Pawns preventing clean integration
- ⚠️ **Scattered Business Logic**: Functions mixed with data in monolithic files
- ⚠️ **Event System**: Message log bugs and display issues
- ⚠️ **Pawn Behavior**: Needs tracking without automated responses

## Current Roadmap Priority
**Phase 1 (Weeks 1-2): Foundation Stabilization**
- Extract business logic from data files into service layer
- Implement GameEngine as central coordinator
- Eliminate circular dependencies between core systems
- Fix critical bugs in event system and pawn behavior

**Phase 2 (Weeks 4-5): Bug Elimination & UI Polish**
- Resolve backend synchronization issues
- Polish user interface and fix visual glitches
- Implement stable save/load functionality

**Phase 3 (Weeks 6-10): Combat System Implementation**
- Gradually reintroduce content with clean architecture
- Implement turn-based tactical combat system
- Integrate combat with existing colony systems

## Target Complexity
The game aims to match Aurora 4x's legendary mechanical depth while remaining genuinely accessible to newcomers. However, **current architecture prevents implementing planned combat features** due to scattered business logic and circular dependencies between core systems.
