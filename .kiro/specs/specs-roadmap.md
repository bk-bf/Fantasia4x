# Fantasia4x Development Roadmap

## 🎉 Major Milestone Achieved: Game Almost Playable!

**BREAKING**: Hunger and rest systems are now fully functional! The game has reached a major milestone where the core survival loop works perfectly. Pawns automatically eat and sleep with realistic mechanics, making the game almost playable.

**CRITICAL MISSING**: Adverse consequences for unmet needs (starvation death, fatigue collapse) - identified as essential for realistic survival gameplay.

## 📋 **UPDATED Development Priority (Real Order)**

**🎯 NEXT PRIORITY**: With GameEngine architecture now clean, focus shifts to screen refactoring and production chains to complete the core gameplay loop.

### 🚨 **Phase 1: Foundation Cleanup (Weeks 1-4)** - ARCHITECTURE COMPLETE ✅

_Fix architecture and screen bloat before adding features_

**🎉 MAJOR MILESTONE**: GameEngine architectural refactoring Phase 1 is complete! The critical architectural debt has been resolved, with GameEngine reduced to a clean coordination-only role and all pawn behavior logic properly extracted to services.

#### 1. ✅ **COMPLETE: Hunger/Rest System** 

- **Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE AND WORKING**
- **Missing**: ⚠️ **Adverse consequences for unmet needs** (Week 6)
- **Achievements**: 
  - Realistic food consumption with direct nutrition mapping
  - Smart sleep duration balancing hunger vs fatigue
  - 5 fatigue recovery per turn with multi-turn sleep sessions
  - Automatic need satisfaction integrated with turn processing
  - Work assignment display properly synchronized
- **Impact**: Game is now almost playable with functional survival mechanics

#### 2. ✅ **gameengine-refactoring** (Week 1 - PHASE 1 COMPLETE)

- **Status**: ✅ **PHASE 1 COMPLETE: Critical architectural debt resolved**
- **Purpose**: Extract most pressing pawn logic from GameEngine (not everything)
- **Scope**: **PHASE 1 COMPLETE** - critical architectural debt resolved
- **Completed Tasks** (Phase 1 - 100%):
  - ✅ Move automatic eating/sleeping logic to PawnService
  - ✅ Move work sync coordination to proper services  
  - ✅ Extract pawn needs coordination from GameEngine to PawnService
  - ✅ Reduce GameEngine to coordination-only role
  - ✅ Update GameEngine coordination patterns for UI components
  - ✅ Complete PawnService implementation for extracted logic
  - ✅ Replace direct pawn logic calls with service coordination
- **Achievements**: 
  - GameEngine reduced from 900+ lines to coordination-only role
  - All pawn behavior logic properly extracted to PawnService
  - Clean service coordination patterns established
  - UI components now use GameEngine as unified interface
  - Proper state flow: GameEngine → Services → Data
- **Remaining** (Phase 2 - Non-critical): UI cleanup, documentation, testing
- **Files**: requirements.md ✅, design.md ✅, tasks.md ✅

#### 3. 🖥️ **screen-refactoring** (Week 2-3 - URGENT)

- **Status**: ❌ **NEW CRITICAL SPEC: Screens are bloated like PawnScreen was**
- **Purpose**: Break down 1-3 most convoluted screens (especially WorkScreen for next tasks)
- **Target Screens**:
  - **WorkScreen.svelte**: 1314 lines - needs healthcare, cooking jobs
  - **CraftingScreen.svelte**: Likely massive, needed for production chains
  - **BuildingMenu.svelte**: Needed for building bonuses
- **Pattern**: Same as pawn-screen-refactoring - directory per screen with components
- **Priority**: **WorkScreen first** (needed for healthcare/cooking jobs)
- **Dependencies**: None (UI refactoring independent)
- **Files**: requirements.md ❌, design.md ❌, tasks.md ❌ (new spec needed)
