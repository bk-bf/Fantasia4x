## 📊 Spec Development Guidelines

### Spec Creation Process

1. **Requirements Phase**: Define user stories and acceptance criteria in EARS format
2. **Design Phase**: Create technical architecture, data models, and component structure
3. **Tasks Phase**: Break down into discrete, manageable coding tasks
4. **Implementation**: Execute tasks with proper testing and validation

### Dependency Management

- **Hard Dependencies**: Must complete before starting dependent spec
- **Soft Dependencies**: Can start in parallel but may need coordination
- **Integration Points**: Identify where specs interact and plan accordingly

### Quality Gates

- **Requirements Review**: User stories complete and acceptance criteria clear
- **Design Review**: Technical approach sound and integrates with existing architecture
- **Tasks Review**: Implementation plan is actionable and properly sequenced
- **Implementation Review**: Code complete, tested, and meets requirements

## 🎯 Critical Success Factors

### Phase 1 Success Criteria

- ✅ Clean architecture with no circular dependencies
- ✅ Service layer operational for all core systems
- ✅ Enhanced research system with three-tier progression
- ✅ All foundation systems stable and tested

### Phase 2 Success Criteria

- ✅ Pawns behave autonomously with needs satisfaction
- ✅ Buildings provide meaningful bonuses and synergies
- ✅ Events create dynamic, choice-driven narratives
- ✅ Exploration provides discovery and progression

### Phase 3 Success Criteria

- ✅ Tactical combat functional with equipment integration
- ✅ AI provides challenging but fair opposition
- ✅ Combat consequences integrate with colony simulation
- ✅ Performance smooth with large battles

### Phase 4 Success Criteria

- ✅ Modding system enables community content
- ✅ Game ready for release with full feature set

## 📋 Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (This Week)

1. **Complete research-enhancement spec**:
   - Create design.md based on gameplay.md research system
   - Create tasks.md with implementation plan
   - Review and approve spec before implementation

2. **Begin pawn-behavior-system spec**:
   - Create requirements.md for automated pawn behavior
   - Focus on needs satisfaction and morale systems
   - Plan integration with existing pawn system

### Medium Term (Next 2-4 Weeks)

1. **Continue spec development** following the roadmap priority order
2. **Maintain dependency awareness** - don't start specs that depend on incomplete ones
3. **Regular reviews** - ensure each spec is complete before moving to implementation
4. **Integration planning** - identify cross-spec coordination needs

### Long Term (Next 3-6 Months)

1. **Follow the roadmap** - resist the temptation to jump ahead to "fun" features
2. **Quality over speed** - better to have fewer, complete systems than many incomplete ones
3. **Regular architecture reviews** - ensure new specs don't break the clean architecture
4. **User feedback integration** - test and refine systems as they're completed

## 🚨 Critical Warnings

### Don't Skip Foundation

- **Architecture refactoring MUST be complete** before starting any other implementation
- **Research enhancement** provides the foundation for all progression systems
- **Pawn behavior** is essential for autonomous gameplay

### Avoid Feature Creep

- **Stick to the roadmap** - new ideas should be evaluated against current priorities
- **Complete specs fully** before moving to the next one
- **Test thoroughly** - each system must be stable before building on it

### Maintain Integration Focus

- **Every spec must integrate cleanly** with the GameEngine architecture
- **Cross-system effects** must be planned and documented
- **Performance considerations** must be evaluated at each phase

**Remember**: The goal is a complete, polished game - not a collection of half-finished features. Follow the roadmap, complete each spec fully, and build a solid foundation for long-term success.
