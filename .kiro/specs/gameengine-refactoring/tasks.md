- **Crafting unlocks better tools** (stone axe ‚Üí iron axe)
- **Research unlocks buildings/crafting** (metallurgy ‚Üí smelter)

#### PRIORITY 3: Balance & Polish ‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM
- **Tool requirements enforcement** (can't mine without pick)
- **Building placement system** (construct buildings at locations)
- **Research progression** (knowledge items + lore discovery)

### üéØ IMMEDIATE ROADMAP (Next Development Phase)

**The game is almost playable! Here's the clear chronological order:**

#### WEEK 1: Architecture Cleanup (Foundation)
1. **Extract GameEngine Pawn Logic** ‚Üí PawnService (Task 4.1-4.2)

   - Move work sync coordination to proper services
   - Reduce GameEngine from 900+ lines to ~400 lines

#### WEEK 2: Production Chain Core (Gameplay)  
2. **Building Effects System** (Task 5.1)
   - Kitchen ‚Üí +40% cooking efficiency  
   - Workshop ‚Üí +25% crafting efficiency
   - Buildings provide tangible gameplay benefits

3. **Basic Tool Crafting** (Task 5.2)
   - Wood tools ‚Üí Stone tools ‚Üí Iron tools progression
   - Tools boost work efficiency significantly
   - Crafting gives progression rewards

#### WEEK 3: Strategic Depth (Complete Loop)
4. **Research ‚Üí Building Chain** (Task 5.3)
   - Research unlocks building types
   - Buildings enable advanced crafting
   - Complete: resource ‚Üí craft ‚Üí build ‚Üí bonus ‚Üí better resources

**After these 3 weeks: Complete production loop game ready for additional features!**

### üéØ SUCCESS CRITERIA
Following the pawn-screen-refactoring success:
- **Data files**: Pure exports only (like extracting UI components)
- **Service files**: Focused business logic (like component-specific logic)
- **GameEngine**: Central coordinator (like PawnScreen orchestrates components)
- **Components**: Clean GameEngine interface usage (like clean component interfaces)

This transforms the business logic architecture from mixed concerns to clean separation, enabling complex feature development just like the UI transformation enabled complex interface features.
  - ‚úÖ Service implementation created
  - ‚ùå **CRITICAL: Business logic NOT removed from Buildings.ts**
  - ‚ùå **CRITICAL: Components still import from Buildings.ts, not BuildingService**
