5. WHEN I discover multiple related lore items THEN they SHALL unlock synergistic research paths
6. IF lore items conflict with my race's capabilities THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate adaptations

### Requirement 4: Stat-Gated Specialization System

**User Story:** As a player, I want my race's weaknesses to become advantages through specialized research, so that every race has unique technological paths and no race is objectively inferior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN my race has average Strength < 8 THEN I SHALL unlock "Mechanical Advantage" research options
2. WHEN my race has average Strength > 15 THEN I SHALL unlock "Brute Force" research specializations
3. WHEN my race has average Intelligence < 8 THEN I SHALL unlock "Instinctual Crafting" paths that bypass complex research
4. WHEN my race has average Intelligence > 15 THEN I SHALL unlock "Advanced Theory" allowing multiple simultaneous research
5. IF my race has extreme stat combinations THEN unique research trees SHALL become available
6. WHEN I research stat-gated technologies THEN they SHALL provide meaningful gameplay advantages that compensate for racial weaknesses

### Requirement 5: Research Integration with Existing Systems

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the research system to integrate cleanly with existing game systems, so that research unlocks enhance rather than complicate the core gameplay loop.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN research unlocks new technologies THEN they SHALL integrate with existing building, crafting, and work systems
2. WHEN I unlock tool technologies THEN they SHALL appear in the crafting system with appropriate requirements
3. WHEN I research building technologies THEN they SHALL become available in the building menu with proper prerequisites
4. IF research unlocks new work categories THEN they SHALL integrate with the existing work assignment system
5. WHEN research affects pawn abilities THEN the changes SHALL be reflected in efficiency calculations
6. IF research unlocks new items THEN they SHALL appear in the appropriate item categories with correct properties

### Requirement 6: Racial Research Narratives

**User Story:** As a player, I want research progression to tell the story of my civilization's technological development, so that each race develops a unique technological identity over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I research technologies THEN the descriptions SHALL reflect my race's approach to the technology
2. WHEN my race discovers lore items THEN the integration SHALL be described in race-appropriate terms
3. WHEN I unlock stat-gated research THEN the explanations SHALL connect to my race's physical or mental characteristics
4. IF my race has specific traits THEN research descriptions SHALL reference how those traits influence technological development
5. WHEN I complete research trees THEN the overall progression SHALL tell a coherent story of my civilization's growth
6. IF I share research discoveries THEN other players SHALL see how my race's unique path differs from theirs

### Requirement 7: Research UI and Feedback

**User Story:** As a player, I want clear information about research options and progress, so that I can make informed decisions about technological development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I open the research screen THEN I SHALL see available research options organized by tier and category
2. WHEN I hover over research options THEN I SHALL see clear prerequisites, costs, and unlocks
3. WHEN I have lore items THEN the research screen SHALL highlight technologies they can unlock
4. IF research is stat-gated THEN the UI SHALL clearly indicate which stats enable or prevent access
5. WHEN research is in progress THEN I SHALL see clear progress indicators and time estimates
6. IF I can't access certain research THEN the UI SHALL explain exactly what requirements I'm missing

### Requirement 8: Research Balance and Progression

**User Story:** As a player, I want research progression to be balanced and meaningful, so that technological advancement provides clear benefits without making the game too easy or too complex.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I unlock new technologies THEN they SHALL provide meaningful but not overpowering advantages
2. WHEN I invest in research THEN the benefits SHALL justify the time and resource costs
3. WHEN I compare research paths THEN different approaches SHALL offer roughly equivalent value through different means
4. IF I focus heavily on research THEN I SHALL gain significant advantages but at opportunity costs in other areas
5. WHEN I unlock advanced technologies THEN they SHALL require appropriate infrastructure and resources to utilize
6. IF I neglect research THEN I SHALL face meaningful disadvantages but still have viable alternative strategies

### Requirement 9: Research System Performance

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the research system to perform efficiently, so that complex research calculations don't impact game performance or save/load times.
