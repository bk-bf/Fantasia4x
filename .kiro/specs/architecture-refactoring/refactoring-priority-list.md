# Architecture Refactoring Priority List

## Overview

This document outlines the critical refactoring priorities for Fantasia4x based on current architectural analysis and TypeScript compilation errors. The priorities are ordered by urgency and dependency relationships to ensure a safe, incremental migration to clean architecture.

## üö® CRITICAL ISSUES (Must Fix First)

### Priority 1: TypeScript Compilation Errors
**Status:** BLOCKING - Prevents development
**Impact:** HIGH - Code doesn't compile
**Effort:** LOW - Quick fixes

#### Issues:
1. **Service Registry Import Errors** (`src/lib/game/services/index.ts`)
   - Missing service instance exports causing shorthand property errors
   - Services not properly instantiated before registry creation

2. **Node.js `require()` Usage** (`BuildingService.ts`, `WorkService.ts`)
   - Using CommonJS `require()` in ES modules
   - Should use ES6 import statements

3. **GameEngine Implementation Errors** (`GameEngineImpl.ts`)
   - Missing constructor arguments for `SystemInteractionCoordinatorImpl`
   - Missing `clearCache()` method on `ModifierSystem`
   - Incorrect method signatures for service calls

4. **Type Definition Mismatches**
   - `EventLog` type not exported from Events module
   - Location type mismatch in WorldGenerator
   - Event trigger parameter type mismatch

#### Action Items:
- [ ] Fix service registry instantiation order
- [ ] Replace `require()` with proper ES6 imports
- [ ] Fix GameEngine constructor and method calls
- [ ] Export missing types and fix type mismatches

---

### Priority 2: Circular Dependency Elimination
**Status:** CRITICAL - Prevents clean architecture
**Impact:** HIGH - Blocks service layer implementation
**Effort:** MEDIUM - Requires careful refactoring

#### Current Circular Dependencies:
```
GameState.ts ‚Üí Work.ts ‚Üí Items.ts ‚Üí (implicit) GameState.ts
Work.ts ‚Üí Items.ts (getItemInfo)
Work.ts ‚Üí Locations.ts ‚Üí (potential) Work.ts
PawnEquipment.ts ‚Üí Items.ts (getItemInfo)
```

#### Root Causes:
1. **Business Logic Mixed with Data**: Functions like `getItemInfo()` in data files
2. **Cross-System Function Calls**: Direct imports between core modules
3. **Shared State Dependencies**: Multiple systems importing GameState

#### Action Items:
- [ ] Extract all business logic functions from `Items.ts` to `ItemService`
- [ ] Remove direct imports between core data files
- [ ] Create service interfaces for cross-system communication
- [ ] Implement dependency injection through GameEngine

---

### Priority 3: Service Layer Completion
**Status:** MOSTLY COMPLETE - Core services implemented
**Impact:** HIGH - Foundation for clean architecture
**Effort:** LOW - Minor completions needed

#### Current Service Status (Updated December 2024):
- ‚úÖ `ItemService` - Fully implemented (`ItemServiceImpl`)
- ‚úÖ `BuildingService` - Fully implemented (`BuildingServiceImpl`)
- ‚úÖ `WorkService` - Fully implemented (`WorkServiceImpl`)
- ‚úÖ `ResearchService` - Fully implemented (`ResearchServiceImpl`)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è `PawnService` - Interface defined, placeholder implementation
- ‚ùå `LocationService` - Not needed (functionality in other services)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è `EventService` - Interface defined, placeholder implementation

#### Remaining Service Work:
1. **PawnService**: Complete implementation for pawn behavior, needs processing, stat calculations
2. **EventService**: Complete implementation for event generation, processing, and integration
3. **Service Integration**: Ensure all services are properly integrated with GameEngine

#### Action Items:
- [ ] Complete PawnService implementation (replace placeholder)
- [ ] Complete EventService implementation (replace placeholder)
- [ ] Validate service integration with GameEngine
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling and validation

## üîß ARCHITECTURAL IMPROVEMENTS (Second Phase)

### Priority 4: GameEngine Central Coordinator
**Status:** ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED - Fully operational
**Impact:** HIGH - Enables complex feature development
**Effort:** COMPLETE - System integration achieved

#### Current Status (Updated December 2024):
1. **GameEngineImpl**: Fully implemented with central coordination
2. **Service Integration**: ServiceRegistry properly injected and operational
3. **Unified Calculations**: ModifierSystem provides automated calculations
4. **State Management**: Consistent patterns through GameEngine
5. **System Protocols**: SystemInteractionCoordinator handles communication

#### Completed Components:
- ‚úÖ GameEngine compilation and implementation
- ‚úÖ Service registry injection and lifecycle management
- ‚úÖ Unified calculation methods (efficiency, effects, crafting time)
- ‚úÖ Consistent state management patterns
- ‚úÖ System interaction protocols and coordination

---

### Priority 5: Data Layer Reorganization
**Status:** NEEDED - Large monolithic files
**Impact:** MEDIUM - Developer experience
**Effort:** MEDIUM - File reorganization

#### Current Issues:
1. **Monolithic Files**: `Items.ts` (2000+ lines), `Buildings.ts` (1000+ lines)
2. **Mixed Concerns**: Data and logic in same files
3. **Poor Organization**: Items not grouped by progression/type
4. **Search Difficulty**: Hard to find specific items/buildings

#### Action Items:
- [ ] Reorganize Items.ts by progression level and type
- [ ] Reorganize Buildings.ts by category and tier
- [ ] Extract all business logic to services
- [ ] Maintain single-file databases for mod compatibility
- [ ] Add comprehensive documentation and indexing

---

### Priority 6: State Management Consistency
**Status:** INCONSISTENT - Multiple patterns
**Impact:** MEDIUM - UI synchronization issues
**Effort:** MEDIUM - Standardize patterns

#### Current Issues:
1. **Multiple State Patterns**: Direct mutation, store updates, GameState manager
2. **Synchronization Problems**: UI components not updating consistently
3. **Save/Load Issues**: State persistence problems
4. **Event System Bugs**: Message log not displaying properly

#### Action Items:
- [ ] Standardize state update patterns through GameEngine
- [ ] Fix Svelte store synchronization
- [ ] Repair save/load functionality
- [ ] Fix event system and message log display

**Effort:** MEDIUM - Optimization work

#### Areas for Optimization:
- [ ] Calculation caching in services
- [ ] Lazy loading of large data structures
- [ ] Component rendering optimization

- Run extended gameplay sessions after major changes

### Communication Strategy
- Document all architectural decisions
- Maintain migration logs with before/after comparisons
- Update team on progress and blockers

## üìù NOTES

### Critical Dependencies
- Priority 1 must be completed before any other work
- Priority 2 and 3 can be worked on in parallel after Priority 1
- Priority 4+ require completion of earlier priorities

### Development Guidelines
- No new features until architecture is stable
- Maintain backward compatibility during migration
- Use feature flags for gradual rollout
- Document all changes for team coordination

### Emergency Procedures
- If refactoring causes critical issues, immediately rollback
- Use backup files to restore working state
- Document what caused the issue before continuing
- Consider alternative approaches if current path is blocked
