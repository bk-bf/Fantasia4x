# Architecture Refactoring Requirements

## Introduction

The Fantasia4x project requires critical architectural refactoring to enable future feature development, particularly the planned combat system. The current architecture suffers from circular dependencies, scattered business logic, and missing central coordination that prevents clean system integration. This refactoring will establish a solid foundation for all future development.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Service Layer Implementation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clean separation between data and business logic, so that I can easily query game data without navigating monolithic files or dealing with circular dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I need to query items THEN the system SHALL provide ItemService with clean query methods
2. WHEN I need to validate building construction THEN the system SHALL provide BuildingService with validation logic
3. WHEN I need to assign work to pawns THEN the system SHALL provide WorkService with assignment logic
4. WHEN I need to check research prerequisites THEN the system SHALL provide ResearchService with progression logic
5. IF I import a service THEN the system SHALL NOT create circular dependency chains
6. WHEN I use any service method THEN the system SHALL return consistent, typed results

### Requirement 2: GameEngine Central Coordinator

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a central GameEngine that coordinates all system interactions, so that I can implement complex features like combat without dealing with scattered calculations and conflicting system states.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN systems need to interact THEN GameEngine SHALL coordinate all interactions through clean interfaces
2. WHEN calculating bonuses or modifiers THEN GameEngine SHALL provide single source of truth for all calculations
3. WHEN processing game turns THEN GameEngine SHALL orchestrate all system updates in correct order
4. WHEN implementing new features THEN GameEngine SHALL provide stable integration points
5. IF any system needs data from another system THEN GameEngine SHALL mediate the interaction
6. WHEN state changes occur THEN GameEngine SHALL ensure consistency across all systems

### Requirement 3: Circular Dependency Elimination

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clean, unidirectional data flow between systems, so that I can understand, test, and modify individual systems without breaking others.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I import any game module THEN the system SHALL NOT create circular import chains
2. WHEN Pawns need Item data THEN the system SHALL use service layer without direct Item imports
3. WHEN Work system needs Pawn data THEN the system SHALL use service layer without direct Pawn imports
4. WHEN Items need Work data THEN the system SHALL use service layer without direct Work imports
5. IF I add new system interactions THEN the system SHALL maintain unidirectional dependency flow
6. WHEN building the project THEN TypeScript SHALL compile without circular dependency warnings

### Requirement 4: Business Logic Extraction

**User Story:** As a developer, I want business logic separated from data definitions, so that I can modify game mechanics without editing large data files and can test logic independently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I need to modify crafting logic THEN I SHALL edit service files, not data files
2. WHEN I need to add new items THEN I SHALL only edit data files, not logic files
3. WHEN I need to test game mechanics THEN I SHALL be able to unit test service methods independently
4. WHEN I need to understand item queries THEN I SHALL find all logic in ItemService, not scattered across files
5. IF I modify business logic THEN the system SHALL NOT require changes to data definitions
6. WHEN I add new game mechanics THEN I SHALL implement them in appropriate service classes

### Requirement 5: Event System Integration

**User Story:** As a player, I want to see all game events and activities in a working message log, so that I can understand what's happening in my civilization and make informed decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN game events occur THEN the system SHALL display them in the message log
2. WHEN I hide the message log THEN I SHALL be able to show it again
3. WHEN pawns perform actions THEN the system SHALL log relevant activities
4. WHEN buildings complete construction THEN the system SHALL notify me through events
5. IF critical events occur THEN the system SHALL highlight them appropriately
6. WHEN I load a saved game THEN the system SHALL restore recent event history

### Requirement 6: Automated Pawn Behavior

**User Story:** As a player, I want pawns to automatically satisfy their basic needs, so that I can focus on strategic decisions rather than micromanaging individual pawn survival.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a pawn's hunger exceeds 90% THEN the pawn SHALL automatically eat available food
2. WHEN a pawn's sleep need exceeds 90% THEN the pawn SHALL automatically go to sleep
3. WHEN a pawn's fatigue exceeds 80% THEN the pawn SHALL automatically rest
4. WHEN a pawn has low morale THEN the pawn SHALL work less efficiently or refuse work
5. IF a pawn cannot satisfy needs THEN the system SHALL show clear indicators and consequences
6. WHEN pawns act on needs THEN the system SHALL log their actions in the activity feed

### Requirement 7: State Management Consistency

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent state management patterns across all components, so that the UI stays synchronized with game state and saves/loads work reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN game state changes THEN all UI components SHALL update reactively
2. WHEN I save the game THEN all current state SHALL be preserved accurately
3. WHEN I load a saved game THEN all systems SHALL restore to exact previous state
4. WHEN components update state THEN they SHALL use consistent patterns through GameEngine
5. IF state synchronization fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages
6. WHEN multiple components access the same data THEN they SHALL always see consistent values

### Requirement 8: Performance and Stability

**User Story:** As a player, I want the game to run smoothly for extended sessions without errors or performance degradation, so that I can enjoy long gameplay sessions without interruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I play for 50+ consecutive turns THEN the system SHALL NOT produce any backend errors
2. WHEN I interact with the UI THEN all responses SHALL be immediate and predictable
3. WHEN the game processes complex calculations THEN performance SHALL remain smooth
4. WHEN I switch between game screens THEN transitions SHALL be fast and glitch-free
5. IF errors occur THEN the system SHALL recover gracefully without data loss
6. WHEN I run the game for extended periods THEN memory usage SHALL remain stable

### Requirement 9: Development Workflow Support

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clean development workflows and testing capabilities, so that I can confidently make changes and additions to the codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run TypeScript compilation THEN the system SHALL complete without circular dependency errors
2. WHEN I run linting THEN the system SHALL pass all code quality checks
3. WHEN I make architectural changes THEN I SHALL be able to test them incrementally
4. WHEN I add new features THEN they SHALL integrate cleanly with existing architecture
5. IF I need to rollback changes THEN I SHALL have clear backup and restoration procedures
6. WHEN I document changes THEN the system SHALL maintain up-to-date architectural documentation

### Requirement 10: Combat System Preparation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the architecture to support complex combat system implementation, so that tactical combat can be added without major refactoring.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing combat THEN the system SHALL provide clean integration points through GameEngine
2. WHEN combat needs item data THEN ItemService SHALL provide all necessary equipment information
3. WHEN combat affects pawns THEN PawnService SHALL handle stat modifications and status effects
4. WHEN combat generates events THEN EventService SHALL integrate combat outcomes with colony systems
5. IF combat requires new calculations THEN GameEngine SHALL coordinate them with existing systems
6. WHEN combat state changes THEN the system SHALL maintain consistency with colony simulation state
