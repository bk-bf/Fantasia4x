# PRODUCTION & EARLY-SURVIVAL EXPANSION — Phase 2

## Status

**Implemented — build green** (`pnpm check` 0 errors; **94 tests**). Every chapter (§A–§G,
§1–§6) plus the cross-cutting architecture is in:

- **Material ladder** §1–§6 (wood→fuel→stone→clay→metal→leather) — all chains craftable.
- **Durability/storage architecture** — per-tile `stored`-drop storage (Stages 1–3); universal
  weather-durability; building condition + repair.
- **Stage 4 behaviours (done):** tool work-wear (`applyToolWear` — stone axe breaks in ~8 fells,
  hooked at harvest), wood **drying** (green→dry at 2-tile fire range, `stepWoodDrying`),
  **tile-aware spoilage** (per-stack `stepItemDecay` with `storageDecayMultiplier` + roof
  enclosure), **`minFuelHeat`** fuel gate, crafting **light penalty** (reads tile `lightLevel`),
  **auto-drink** + **dehydration** condition (lethal). All unit-tested.
- **Recipe registry** — recipes are first-class (`RecipeService`, `recipes.jsonc`): items =
  pure materials; recipes carry **byproducts** (log→firewood+branches, →planks+sawdust,
  →charcoal+ash) emitted by JobService; reverse `producedBy`/`usedIn` indexes; CraftingScreen
  is recipe-aware. The 97 inline recipes are auto-registered via synthesis (their physical
  relocation out of `items.jsonc` is deferred — cosmetic only, avoided to not reformat the
  hand-aligned file).

Remaining is content/Living-World scope explicitly out of this spec (drink/wash-zone *routing*,
weather, fire-spread, magic).

| Foundation (types)                     | ✅     | needs `thirst`/`hygiene`, `drink`/`wash` designations, item `deterioration`/`durabilityLossPerAction`/`fuelHeat`, building `minFuelHeat`/`fluxPerBatch`/`moldRequired`/`storageDecayMultiplier`/`requiresEnclosure`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| §A Forageables & loose stone           | ✅     | 5 named rocks (granite/limestone/sandstone/marble/slate) replace `surface_stone`; terrain-distributed yields; stone `hearth`. **Any-rock stations live**: `buildingCost` now supports **`category:<cat>` slots** (`resolveBuildingCost` — the building-cost analogue of a recipe's `acceptsCategory`); `hearth` costs `category:stone` 8, built from any mix of rock types (`buildingCost.test`) |
| §B Durability & Deterioration          | ✅     | **Durability = the elements wearing an item apart** (≠ food spoilage, which is a separate rot timer). **EVERY item** has a durability pool: `maxDurability` (default 100) drained by `deteriorationRate`/tick **only while loose/exposed** (category defaults so all items weather — stone slow, organics fast; per-item override; rate 0 = immune), **destroyed at 0**, halted when stored/sheltered. Live + tested (`stepItemDeterioration` count-down + `deteriorationRateFor`). **building** condition decay + repair also live + tested. **Pending Stage 4**: per-stack **tool** work-wear at work-action completion                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Storage refactor** (per-tile stacks) | ✅     | Plan: `~/.claude/plans/streamed-napping-wave.md`. **Stages 1–3 ✅** done + green (73 tests): per-tile `stored` DroppedItems are now the **source of truth**; `addToStockpileZone`/`consumeFromStockpiles`/`absorbDropIfOnStockpileTile` rewritten drops-authoritative; aggregate summed from drops; per-tile capacity (`BASE_TILE_CAPACITY` + building `tileCapacityBonus`, advisory); zones = pure drop-off designations (`inventory` vestigial, cleared on init); UI per-zone view derives from drops; building `condition`+repair. Hauling/crafting/butchery tests intact. **Stage 4 (pending):** wire per-stack **tool durability** at work-action completion (closes §B case 3) + **tile-aware decay/deterioration/drying** (roof/enclosure, 2-tile fire proximity) — lands with §F/§1 |
| §1 Wood                                | ✅     | **Data ✅**: 5 species logs (pine/birch/oak/ash/yew; world-sourced from trees — pine primary + oak/birch chance), `green_firewood`→`dry_firewood`, 5 planks, `saw` (bronze-gated), `chopping_block`+`sawtable` buildings; `wood_log` fully migrated→`pine_log`. **Pending**: drying (green→dry by 2-tile fire proximity) → Stage 4; branch byproduct of chopping (one output/recipe today) |
| §2 Fuel & Heat                         | ✅     | **Data ✅**: `peat` (dug from bogs), `charcoal` (Charcoal Pit, from logs/firewood), `coal` (mined in mountains), `ash` (burnt at hearth → feeds §6 curing); fuel `fuelHeat` ladder set (firewood 1–2 / peat 2 / charcoal 3 / coal 4); `charcoal_pit` building. **Pending**: `minFuelHeat` gating enforced when forges/kilns exist (§4/§5)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| §3 Stone                               | ✅     | 5 cut blocks/tiles (`granite_block`/`limestone_block`/`sandstone_block`/`marble_block`/`slate_tile`) at new `masons_bench`, from raw rock (already quarried via §A from walls/outcrops with a pick)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| §4 Clay & Ceramics                     | ✅     | `fired_brick`, `water_urn` (container), `clay_mold` + `tile_mold`, `clay_roof_tile`; `pottery_kiln` (`minFuelHeat: 2`, **enforced** — needs peat/charcoal heat). `clay_lump`/`mud_brick` pre-existing. Clay molds are now **required + worn** by casting (§5)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| §5 Ore → Metal                         | ✅     | Named minerals (malachite/chalcopyrite/azurite→copper, cassiterite→tin, hematite/magnetite/limonite→iron, galena→lead/silver, native_gold/electrum→gold) replace generic ore yields; bars copper/tin/bronze/iron/lead/silver/gold/steel (DF-style many-ore recipes + **limestone flux** in iron/steel costs); `stone_forge`/`bloomery`/`anvil`; copper/tin lowered to tier-1 (bronze before iron). **`minFuelHeat` gate live** (bloomery needs coal-heat); **casting-mold requirement live + tested** — forges declare `moldRequired: clay_mold`; `canCraftItem` blocks casting without one, and each cast wears it (`wearToolById`), cracking after 10 pours (`castingMold.test`). Completes clay→kiln→mold→forge |
| §6 Hide → Leather                      | ✅     | Two-step gate: raw hides now **spoil** (`decaySeconds`→`rotten_hide`); cure at `hide_rack` (hide + ash/salt → 5 `cured_*_hide` grades, stable); tan at `tanning_rack` (cured + bark → 5 leather grades thin/light/sturdy/heavy/thick). `tanning_rack` gated behind `tanning_bucket` (planks → bronze-age). `ash` (§2) and `bark`/planks (§1) cross-link in                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| §C Food preservation                   | ✅     | **Data ✅**: `salt` (mined from mountains, moderately rare — competes with §6 curing), `salted_meat` (butcher + salt, ~36000s keep) and `dried_meat` (Drying Rack, salt-free, ~28000s) as dynamic-recipe products over any `meat`; `drying_rack` building; raw meats already spoil fast. **Pending**: tune salt scarcity vs. demand. **Building names** made historically-grounded (Stonecutter's Banker / Sawpit / Charcoal Clamp / Potter's Kiln / Smelting Hearth / Bloomery Furnace / Smithy / Curing Frame / Tannery)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| §D Water needs                         | ✅     | `thirst`/`hygiene` accrue each tick; parched/filthy pawns lose mood; **meals quench thirst**; **dehydration condition** (lethal, faster than starvation). Relief: **auto-drink/auto-wash** in place (stored water / adjacent river) **+ pathfind-to-zone routing** — when thirst/hygiene gets urgent and no stored water, a pawn walks to a player-painted `drink`/`wash` zone (or a `well`) via the `MOVING_TO_NEED` flow and the new `Drinking`/`Washing` states, then drinks/washes (`findNearestWaterTarget`/`handleDrinking`/`handleWashing`). `water` item + `well` building. (`autoDrink.test`) |
| §E Trapping                            | ✅     | `snare_trap` (Snare) + `deadfall` (Deadfall Trap) buildings; `buildingService.stepTraps` rolls each complete trap's `catchChance` per tick and deposits its `catchItem` carcass at the trap tile, wired into the building tick. (Probabilistic success path not unit-tested; per-tick chances may need tuning.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| §F Storage & roofs                     | ✅     | **Data ✅ + capacity live**: `hay_store`/`log_store`/`clay_cellar` raise their tile's capacity via `tileCapacityBonus` (functional — Stage 2) and carry `storageDecayMultiplier`; roof tiles `thatch_roof`/`plank_roof`/`tile_roof` (thatch decays fast, tile lasts). Durable goods halt deterioration when stored (§B); **`storageDecayMultiplier` is wired into organic spoilage** (`stepItemDecay`, roof-shelter approximation for enclosure). **Full walls+roof+door enclosure** → [Living World](SEASONS_WEATHER.md) Subsystem 7 (shared with temperature)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| §G Shelter & Light                     | ✅     | **Data**: `thatch/plank/tile_roof` (+`transparentRoof`), `door`, `window`; `animal_fat`, `torch`, `candle`. **Light→work ✅ (unified via sight)**: the tile `lightLevel` is fed as `lightMultiplier` into `computeCapacities` → scales the `sight` capacity, which every `*_speed` formula in stats.jsonc already multiplies by — so darkness slows all work through the existing model (0.4 floor in pitch dark). This replaced an initial parallel `workPoints` penalty; verified the sight-light path was previously **dormant** (`lightMultiplier` never supplied; crafting speed used `calculateWorkEfficiency` which ignores `sight`) — **no duplicate mechanic**. Tested (`lightWork.test`). Roof weather-shelter for loose items also live (§F decay). **Window-daylight injection, torch/candle as placeable point lights, enclosure** → moved to [Living World](SEASONS_WEATHER.md) Subsystem 7 |
| **Recipe registry** (recipes.jsonc)    | ✅     | Architectural cleanup so recipes are first-class (items = pure materials; recipes have **byproducts**/multi-output + reverse lookups). **Stage A ✅ + tested**: `Recipe` type, `recipes.jsonc`, `RecipeService` (authored ∪ synthesised-from-inline, authored shadows synth per output; `producedBy`/`usedIn` indexes); seeded byproduct recipes (log→firewood+branches, →planks+sawdust, →charcoal+ash). **Inert** (not yet wired). **Pending B–D**: wire ItemService craftability reads to the registry; rework craft-*quantity* semantics + JobService **multi-output emission** (the thing that makes byproducts real); migrate the 97 inline recipes + CraftingScreen UI |

Phase 1 (primitives through Maker's Bench) is archived.

The **full detailed early-game progression** — forage → fire → primitive tools →
food preservation → shelter & light → water → storage → clay → leather → copper
→ planks → iron → steel. Each step is a production/preservation chain and they
interlock. The deterministic ceiling is **steel / steampunk**. Workshops are
defined **inline in the chapter that uses them** (no central workshop list).

**Out of scope (own specs):**

- Food rot from **exposure to the elements** (rain, heat, frost) → owned by
  [Living World / SEASONS_WEATHER](SEASONS_WEATHER.md) Phase B. This spec handles
  **intrinsic** decay (item `decaySeconds`) + the storage/enclosure that scales it.
- Procedural endgame metals (rolled *Adamantite*-style ores) →
  [PROCEDURAL-METALS](PROCEDURAL-METALS.md).
- **Equipment durability depth** (combat decay, efficiency curve) → owned by
  [EQUIPMENT-EXPANSION](EQUIPMENT-EXPANSION.md). This spec **reuses** that
  `durability` field and adds **work-usage** wear (§B).
- Disease from bad water / poor hygiene, and dynamic **fire-spread risk** → Living
  World. This spec only notes where those hooks attach.

## Design Philosophy

Medieval **fantasy**, no industrial/space climb. The tech ceiling is roughly
**steampunk**, so we don't get *width* from many ages — we get **depth** inside
each age. Every age should be more detailed, complex, and timely to progress than
even RimWorld *Hardcore SK + Viles*. Draw production patterns from **Dwarf
Fortress, Vintage Story, TerraFirmaCraft, and Clanfolk**: long multi-step chains,
intermediate goods, real preservation pressure, fuel/heat logistics, tools that
wear out, and meaningful "what do I build next" decisions.

A mature colony differentiates by **magic** and a one-of-a-kind signature metal,
not by reaching a higher age. Those layers are deferred; this one delivers the
mundane foundation they sit on.

## Note on existing data / engine hooks

- Data lives in `src/lib/game/database/*.jsonc` (items, buildings, resources),
  **not** the `core/*.ts` files the archived spec referenced.
- Work categories `mining`, `metalworking`, `leatherworking`, `cooking`,
  `caretaking`, `hauling`, `woodcutting`, `crafting` **already exist** in
  `core/Work.ts`. Tool tiers (`stone_axe`/`iron_axe`, `stone_pick`/…) too.
- **Spoilage already works**: items carry `decaySeconds` + `decaysTo`
  (`ItemService` + `GameEngine`); meat decays to `rotten_food`.
- **Durability already exists**: `Item.durability` (0–100) + combat decay is
  spec'd in EQUIPMENT-EXPANSION. Reuse it; §B adds work-usage decay.
- Needs are `pawn.needs = { hunger, fatigue, sleep }`; this spec adds `thirst`
  and `hygiene`.
- A **LightingService** + per-tile light + campfire point light already ship
  (SEASONS_WEATHER Phase A2). §G torches/hearth feed that, and read it for the
  crafting-light penalty.
- Storage today is container **items** (`woven_basket`). This spec adds storage
  **buildings** + a decay/deterioration multiplier.

## Early-Game Progression Spine

```
1.  Forage   : loose rock (granite/limestone/…), flint, branches, hay, fiber
               → primitive tools + Tier-1 stations (workbench, hearth, butcher)
2.  Fire     : campfire/hearth; chop trees (stone axe) → logs → firewood; season dry
3.  Hunt/eat : meat nutritious but rots fast; fat → torches
4.  Preserve : halite (salt) → salt meat; smoke-dry over fire
5.  Shelter  : daub/mud walls + roof + door + window → enclosed; torches = work light
6.  Trap     : snares & deadfalls → passive small game
7.  Water    : river / boil in clay urn / dig a Well
8.  Storage  : basket → hay store → log store → clay cellar (slows deterioration)
9.  Clay     : clay → mud brick → fired brick + urns + casting molds (kiln)
10. Copper   : charcoal/coal heat; malachite → copper bar; cast in clay molds → bronze
11. Planks   : bronze → saw → Sawtable → planks (unlock furniture/cooking/storage/walls/roofs)
12. Leather  : cure hides early (or they rot) → tan in plank buckets w/ bark → 5 grades
13. Iron     : bloomery + coal + limestone flux → iron bar
14. Steel    : cast steel  →  [steampunk ceiling]
```

§A–§G are cross-cutting survival systems; §1–§6 are the production chapters.

## §A. Forageables & loose stone (multi-type)

The very early loop is hand-gathering. **There is no generic "fieldstone."**
Loose surface stone is the **real rock type** of the local terrain, foraged in
**small amounts** by hand from scree near outcrops — the same five rocks §3
quarries in bulk once a pick exists.

| Forageable      | id                  | From                                                  | Feeds                          |
| --------------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Loose rock (×5) | `granite` … `slate` | scree near matching outcrop (bare hands, small yield) | Tier-1 stations, daub, hearth  |
| Flint           | `flint_shard`       | gravel, stone outcrops                                | knives, sickles, firestarter   |
| Branch          | `branch`            | trees, fallen logs                                    | tools, traps, wattle, firewood |
| Hay             | `hay`               | tall grass                                            | thatch roof, bedding, baskets  |
| Plant fiber     | `plant_fiber`       | grass, scrub                                          | cordage → rope                 |

**Tier-1 primitive stations** are built from loose rock (any type) + wood, before
any pick or metal:

| Station         | id              | Build cost (example)                | Enables                                          |
| --------------- | --------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Workbench       | `makers_bench`* | 6× loose rock + 4× branch + 2× rope | primitive tools, cordage                         |
| Hearth          | `hearth`        | 8× loose rock + 4× branch           | cooking, boiling, warmth, light, **wood drying** |
| Butcher's block | `butcher_block` | 4× loose rock + 2× log              | carcass → meat/hide/fat/bone                     |

\* `makers_bench` exists; retune its cost to loose rock. Rock *type* can flavour
station appearance/decor but does not gate function (any rock works).

---

## §B. Durability & Deterioration (all items)

> **Impl status:** durable-goods deterioration (case 3) is implemented +
> unit-tested (`itemService.stepItemDeterioration`, stepped in the turn loop;
> `itemDeterioration.test.ts`). Tool work-usage decay (case 2) needs a
> per-instance/per-stack tool-durability model the engine doesn't have yet — that
> model is owned by [EQUIPMENT-EXPANSION](EQUIPMENT-EXPANSION.md), so the wear
> *loop* lands there; the data hooks (`durabilityLossPerAction` on `stone_axe`)
> are seeded here.

Everything degrades. Add a deterioration model spanning three coordinated cases;
all of them are scaled by storage/enclosure (§F).

1. **Perishables** (food, raw hide) — existing `decaySeconds` → `decaysTo`.
2. **Tool & equipment wear** — reuse `Item.durability` (0–100, EQUIPMENT-EXPANSION).
   This spec adds **work-usage decay**: each work action spends durability scaled
   by **tool tier**. Beginner tools are deliberately fragile — a `stone_axe`
   should break after only a handful of fells.

   | Tier            | Durability loss / action | ≈ uses before break |
   | --------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------- |
   | Stone (Tier 0)  | ~12                      | ~8                  |
   | Bronze (Tier 1) | ~5                       | ~20                 |
   | Iron (Tier 2)   | ~2.5                     | ~40                 |
   | Steel (ceiling) | ~1.2                     | ~80                 |

   At 0 the tool breaks (consumed; may drop a salvage scrap). This forces an
   early, repeated tool economy — the player keeps re-knapping stone tools until
   metal arrives.
3. **Durable-goods deterioration** — non-perishable stockpiled goods (planks,
   bars, blocks) carry a slow `deterioration` (0–100) that creeps up **only from
   elemental exposure in the open**. Storing them **inside any container**
   (basket, urn, chest) or in an **enclosed** building (walls + roof + door)
   **completely halts** it — stored durables take *no* exposure damage, it is not
   merely slowed (§F). Loose in the open they deteriorate; unroofed storage is
   worse still. At 100 the item is ruined (→ scrap/rubble). Clay **molds** (§4)
   are the exception: they wear from **use** (each cast), not exposure, so storage
   doesn't save them. Organic items in the same container still **spoil**
   (`decaySeconds`) — storage only slows that, never stops it (§F).

Field additions: `durabilityLossPerAction?` on tools; `deteriorationRate?` on
durable items (per-turn base, zeroed by any container/enclosure).

---

## §C. Food spoilage & preservation

Meat is the early game's best calorie source (high `nutrition`) but rots fast
(short `decaySeconds` → `rotten_food`). Preservation is the first real tech goal.

**Salt.** Add **halite** (rock salt) — moderately rare, mined in mountains
(`halite` node → `salt`). The gating scarcity.

| Method        | Station          | Recipe                   | Result (`decaySeconds`)    |
| ------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| Salting       | Butcher's block  | `raw_meat` + `salt`      | `salted_meat` (~10× raw)   |
| Air/smoke-dry | **Drying Rack**  | `raw_meat` + fuel (slow) | `dried_meat` (~8× raw)     |
| Cooking       | Hearth → Kitchen | `raw_meat` + ingredient  | `cooked_meal` (nutri+mood) |

**Drying Rack** (`drying_rack`) — a dedicated preservation **workshop**, built
early from branches + cordage (+ hide). Air- or smoke-dries `raw_meat` (also
fish/herbs) into long-keeping `dried_meat`. Slow and fuel-light, it's the
**salt-free** preservation path — so the player isn't forced to spend scarce salt
(which §6 curing also wants) on every kill.

Storage (§F) stretches these further; raw meat on open ground rots almost at once.

---

## §D. Water — thirst & hygiene needs

Add two needs to `pawn.needs`, accruing each turn like hunger:

| Need    | Field     | Relief                                              | Neglect                                  |
| ------- | --------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Thirst  | `thirst`  | drink at water tile/urn/well; **eating a meal** too | mood↓ → dehydration condition → collapse |
| Hygiene | `hygiene` | wash at water / wash basin; passive decay           | mood↓; (deferred) disease → Living World |

**Meals also restore thirst** (partially) — eating a `cooked_meal`/`stew` quenches
some thirst, so hydration is a real need but not constant micro-busywork.

**Drinking paths (progression):**

1. **Raw water** — drink at a river/lake tile. Free but *untreated*: small
   hygiene/mood hit now; disease risk later (Living World).
2. **Boiled water** — boil at hearth/campfire (`water` + fuel) → store in a **clay
   urn** (`water_urn`). Safe, portable; lets inland pawns drink.
3. **Well** (`well` building) — needs a digging tool (`digging_stick`/
   `stone_spade`) and a **costly** recipe (rock + log + rope + heavy labour).
   Safe water with no adjacent river → unlocks dry-site settling.

New states: `Thirsty` / `Drinking` / `Washing` (mirror `Hungry`/`Eating`).

**Drink & wash zones.** Add player-paintable `drink` and `wash` zone designations
(mirroring the existing `harvest`/`forage`/`scavenge` zones) so the player
controls *where* pawns go — a clean upstream tile, a urn shelf, a wash basin —
instead of always the nearest (possibly fouled) water. A pawn meeting its thirst
need walks to a `drink` zone (or any water if none set); hygiene sends it to a
`wash` zone via the `Washing` state.

---

## §E. Trapping

Passive hunting so a small colony need not keep standing hunters out. Traps are
**buildings** that periodically capture small game, then must be reset.

| Trap | id  | Build cost | Catches |
| ---- | --- | ---------- |------------------ | ----------------------- |
| Snare       | `snare_trap`  | 2× branch + 1× cordage    | rabbit, rat, small game |
| Deadfall    | `deadfall`    | 3× branch + 4× loose rock | rabbit, boar (rare)     |
| Baited trap | `baited_trap` | snare + 1× food bait      | higher catch rate       |

Each active trap rolls a low per-turn capture chance; on success it holds a
carcass and goes inactive until a pawn resets it (reuse `hunting`). Bait improves
odds.

---

## §F. Storage, roofs & deterioration mitigation

Storage affects the two decay tracks **differently**:

- **Elemental `deterioration`** (durable goods): any **container** (basket, urn,
  chest) or **enclosed** building **stops it entirely** — stored durables take no
  exposure damage at all. Only goods left loose **in the open** deteriorate, and
  **unroofed** storage is *worse than* bare ground (a penalty multiplier >1).
- **Organic `decaySeconds`** (spoilage): storage only **slows** it via
  `storageDecayMultiplier` (<1); it is **never** fully halted — preserve via
  salting/drying (§C) to extend further. Open ground = 1.0.

**Roof as a buildable tile.** A `roof` placement builds like a wall but on the
overhead layer. A storage building earns its full multiplier only when
**enclosed** (walls + roof + door). Roofs tier up alongside storage.

| Tier | Building / container  | Build cost                                       | Mult | Roof      |
| ---- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ---- | --------- |
| 0    | Woven basket (exists) | cordage (portable)                               | ~0.8 | no        |
| 1    | Hay store / thatch    | hay + branch + cordage; thatch roof              | ~0.7 | thatch    |
| 2    | Log store             | logs + loose rock; plank roof*                   | ~0.5 | timber    |
| 3    | Clay cellar           | fired brick + clay urns; **clay-tile roof** (§G) | ~0.3 | clay tile |

\* Plank-based upgrades (§1) become available after bronze. Multipliers stack with
the preservation method: salted meat in a clay cellar keeps a long time. (Note:
the `~mult` values are the *organic spoilage* slowdown; elemental deterioration of
durables is simply **off** inside any of these — see the two tracks above.)

**Roof tiers:** thatch (hay) → timber (plank) → **clay tile** (molded + fired,
§G) — each slower-deteriorating and lower-maintenance than the last.

---

## §G. Shelter & Light

`daub_wall` and `mud_brick_wall` exist. Pair them with new build tiles to enclose
a hut and to let work happen after dark.

| Build tile | id         | Cost (example)               | Role                                         |
| ---------- | ---------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Roof       | `roof_*`   | thatch/plank/tile by tier    | overhead layer; enables enclosure            |
| Door       | `door_*`   | planks (or wattle early)     | access + completes enclosure seal            |
| Window     | `window_*` | wattle early; later shutters | lets **daylight** in → less torch use by day |

**Clay roof tiles (top tier).** The tile roof isn't just placed — it's
**manufactured**. Cast a reusable **tile mold** (`tile_mold`) at the forge/
bloomery, press clay into it, and fire the pressing at the Pottery Kiln →
`clay_roof_tile`. Compared with thatch or plank roofs, a clay-tile roof
**deteriorates far slower and needs much less rebuild/repair**, and (once Living
World lands) is **more robust against weather hazards** — the payoff for the extra
mold → press → fire chain, and what makes it the prestige top tier.

**Roof rendering.** The roof is **visually transparent** (the player still sees
the tiles and pawns beneath it) but it **casts shade and blocks/alters light** in
the lighting model: a roofed interior reads as darker by day (raising the
crafting-light demand for torches) and shelters the tile. Coordinate with the
LightingService / Living World lighting pass so roof shadow is both a gameplay
input and a visible effect, not just a flat overlay.

**Light matters for crafting.** Read the existing per-tile light value
(LightingService): work in darkness suffers an efficiency penalty (and fine work
may be blocked). Daylight, hearth/campfire light, windows (by day), and **torches**
remove it.

| Light source  | id       | Recipe                              | Notes                              |
| ------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Torch         | `torch`  | 1× branch + 1× `animal_fat` + fiber | priority early item; burns N turns |
| Tallow candle | `candle` | `animal_fat` + fiber wick           | longer, dimmer; later              |

`animal_fat` is a **butcher** by-product — rendering fat is the realistic early
fuel for portable light. Hearth/campfire double as fixed light. Torches feed the
existing point-light system; placing fire near stored dry wood (§1) is what later
introduces **fire-spread risk** (Living World).

---

## §1. Wood — species, firewood, drying & planks

Replace the single `tree` node and `wood_log`. Five species, each a biome-spread
tree node yielding a named **log** + shared `bark`/`branch` by-products (bark
feeds tanning, §6).

| Species | log id      | Role / property                                   | Workability | Fuel |
| ------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ---- |
| Pine    | `pine_log`  | Softwood — cheap bulk construction & fuel; common | fast        | low  |
| Birch   | `birch_log` | Light utility; best firewood; bark-rich           | fast        | high |
| Oak     | `oak_log`   | Hardwood — furniture, heavy beams, durable        | slow        | med  |
| Ash     | `ash_log`   | Tough/springy — tool hafts, polearms, shields     | med         | med  |
| Yew     | `yew_log`   | Premium, rare — bows & fine furniture             | slow        | med  |

**Chopping → logs.** A primitive **axe** (`stone_axe`) unlocks felling trees
(`woodcutting` → species logs). No axe = no logs (only foraged branches).

**Chopping Block** (`chopping_block`) — built from 1× log and **requires an axe**
to construct. Processes logs → **firewood** + **branches** (+ kindling).

```
log  ──Chopping Block──►  green_firewood ×N  +  branch ×M
```

**Wood drying.** Firewood comes out **green** (`green_firewood`). Stored **within
2 tiles of a fire** (hearth/campfire) — *not* directly adjacent — it seasons over
in-game time into **dry firewood** (`dry_firewood`), which has the highest
`fuelValue`/heat. Green wood burns poorly (low heat, more smoke). Direct adjacency
to fire is allowed but later carries fire-spread risk (Living World). Peat (§2)
dries the same way.

**Sawtable** (`sawtable`) — gated behind a **saw** (`saw`), which itself needs a
**`bronze_bar`** (so planks are a **bronze-age** unlock, not primitive). The
Sawtable turns logs → **planks** (+ sawdust).

```
bronze_bar ──► saw ──► build Sawtable ──► log → plank ×K (+ sawdust)
```

**Planks are a keystone unlock** — they gate a wide upgrade tier:

- Better **furniture** (beds, chairs, tables → comfort/rest/mood)
- **Cooking** upgrades (Kitchen, drying/smoke racks, counters)
- **Storage** tier-2+ (log store → plank shelving; tanning **buckets**, §6)
- **Walls, doors, roofs** (plank-framed, sturdier than wattle/daub)
- Tool **hafts** and shields (with the right species)

This makes "reach bronze → make a saw → unlock planks" a deliberate, high-value
early goal that opens many branches at once.

---

## §2. Fuel & Heat

The production chain runs on **heat**, and heat tiers gate what you can make.
Each fuel has a `fuelValue` (already on items) and an effective **heat** rating;
each fire/kiln/forge declares a `minFuelHeat` it must meet to operate.

| Fuel           | id               | Source                               | Heat    | Notes                           |
| -------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------- | ------------------------------- |
| Green firewood | `green_firewood` | Chopping Block (fresh)               | low     | smoky; season it first          |
| Dry firewood   | `dry_firewood`   | seasoned near fire (§1)              | low-mid | best wood fuel; campfire/hearth |
| Peat           | `peat`           | **dug** from bog/mud deposits        | mid     | cheap, smoky; dry like wood     |
| Charcoal       | `charcoal`       | **Charcoal Pit** (pyrolysis of wood) | high    | clean; needed to smelt metal    |
| Coal           | `coal`           | **mined** (seams in mountains/cave)  | high+   | iron/steel; efficient           |

**Charcoal Pit** (`charcoal_pit`) — load logs/firewood, smoulder over time →
`charcoal` (+ `ash` by-product, which feeds hide curing §6). A slow batch job; the
first way to reach metal-smelting heat before coal seams are found.

Heat gates: hearth/campfire (firewood/peat) → **copper/bronze** smelting needs
**charcoal or coal** → **iron/steel** needs **coal** (or heavy charcoal) + flux.

### Forge fuel & flux consumption model (the player liked this)

Stone Forge, Bloomery and kilns consume **fuel** each active turn (campfire
mechanism). Higher-heat fuel works; below `minFuelHeat` the station won't light.
Iron smelting additionally consumes **limestone flux** per batch.

```typescript
// BuildingDefinition additions
fuelConsumptionRate: number;      // fuel units per active turn
acceptedFuels: string[];          // e.g. ["coal", "charcoal", "dry_firewood"]
minFuelHeat: number;              // station won't operate below this
fluxPerBatch?: number;            // bloomery: limestone consumed per batch
moldRequired?: string;            // casting: clay mold consumed/worn per cast (§4)
storageDecayMultiplier?: number;  // storage buildings: scales decay + deterioration
requiresEnclosure?: boolean;      // storage: full multiplier only when enclosed
```

Running out of fuel mid-batch pauses the station and loses that item's progress.

---

## §3. Stone — quarrying the 5 rock types

The five rocks of §A, foraged loose in small amounts, are **quarried in bulk**
from outcrops / mountain & cliff walls with a **pick**, then cut into **blocks** at
a **Mason's Bench** (`masons_bench`; built from loose rock + log, Tier-1).

| Rock      | raw id      | block id          | Role / property                              |
| --------- | ----------- | ----------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Granite   | `granite`   | `granite_block`   | Hard, strong — premium walls, prestige decor |
| Limestone | `limestone` | `limestone_block` | Soft; also **smelting flux** + mortar (§5)   |
| Sandstone | `sandstone` | `sandstone_block` | Soft, cheap bulk building; decorative        |
| Marble    | `marble`    | `marble_block`    | Prestige — statues, fine floors; slow to cut |
| Slate     | `slate`     | `slate_tile`      | Roofing (tier-3 roof) & flat tiles           |

Limestone is the key cross-link: building stone **and** the flux iron smelting
consumes.

---

## §4. Clay & Ceramics — bricks, urns, **casting molds**

Clay (`clay_lump`, dug from clay/mud deposits) is the ceramics line and, crucially,
the source of **casting molds** that gate all metalwork (§5).

**Pottery Kiln** (`pottery_kiln`) — built from loose rock + clay; consumes fuel
(needs `minFuelHeat` ≈ peat/charcoal). Fires green clay goods hard.

| Product       | id            | From                      | Use                                      |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Mud brick     | `mud_brick`   | clay (sun-dried, no kiln) | primitive walls/shelter                  |
| Fired brick   | `fired_brick` | clay → kiln               | forges, kilns, clay cellar, sturdy walls |
| Clay urn      | `water_urn`   | clay → kiln               | boiled-water storage (§D)                |
| **Clay mold** | `clay_mold`   | clay → kiln               | **required to cast metal** (§5)          |

**Clay molds** are reusable but **deteriorate fast** and crack with each cast
(§B) — an ongoing ceramics demand that ties metal output to clay supply. Different
mold shapes gate different casts (ingot mold vs. tool/weapon molds).

---

## §5. Ore → Metal (many ores → one metal; cast in molds)

Mined ores carry **proper mineral names**; several minerals smelt to the same base
metal. Smelting + casting both consume **heat fuel** (charcoal/coal/peat, §2) and
casting consumes a **clay mold** (§4). Alloys (bronze, steel) are **cast**, not
mined.

**Stone Forge** (`stone_forge`) — built from fired brick + loose rock; smelts
copper/tin and casts bronze. **Bloomery** (`bloomery`) — fired brick + rock; iron
+ flux. **Anvil** (`anvil`) — bars → tools/weapons/armor (also mold-cast or forged).

| Base metal  | bar id                    | Feeder ore minerals (node ids)         | Smelt needs                  |
| ----------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Copper      | `copper_bar`              | `malachite`, `chalcopyrite`, `azurite` | charcoal/coal + mold         |
| Tin         | `tin_bar`                 | `cassiterite`                          | charcoal/coal + mold         |
| Iron        | `iron_bar`                | `hematite`, `magnetite`, `limonite`    | coal + limestone flux + mold |
| Lead/Silver | `lead_bar` / `silver_bar` | `galena`                               | charcoal/coal + mold         |
| Gold        | `gold_bar`                | `native_gold`, `electrum`              | charcoal/coal + mold         |

| Alloy  | bar id       | Cast from (+ fuel + clay mold)       | Tier    |
| ------ | ------------ | ------------------------------------ | ------- |
| Bronze | `bronze_bar` | 3× copper_bar + 1× tin_bar           | Tier 1  |
| Steel  | `steel_bar`  | 2× iron_bar + 1× coal + 1× limestone | ceiling |

Richer minerals (chalcopyrite) yield more bar per smelt than lean ones (azurite).
Bronze → first **saw** → **planks** (§1), so the metal and wood chains interlock.

## §6. Hide → Cure → Tan → Leather (two-step gate)

A raw hide is **perishable**: each `*_hide`/`*_pelt` gets `decaySeconds` →
`rotten_hide` if untreated. Leather is gated behind two steps, split across ages.

**Step 1 — Curing (Hide Rack, primitive/early).** `hide_rack` built from branches
+ cordage. Preserves the hide so it stops decaying — letting the player **stockpile
cured hides early** for tanning later.

| Station   | Recipe                                  | Time   | Result                    |
| --------- | --------------------------------------- | ------ | ------------------------- |
| Hide Rack | 1× `*_hide` + (2× `ash` **or** 1× salt) | long\* | `cured_<hide>` (no decay) |

\* Multi-turn job. Ash (charcoal-pit/fire by-product) is the cheap path; salt is
faster but competes with food salting.

**Step 2 — Tanning (Tanning Rack, needs planks).** `tanning_rack` requires **plank
tanning buckets** — so full leather is a **bronze/plank-age** unlock (§1). Cured
hides soak with **bark** (tannin) and sort into 5 grades; raw hide cannot be tanned.

| Grade  | leather id       | Cured from (source hides) | Use                         |
| ------ | ---------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Thin   | `thin_leather`   | rabbit, rat pelt          | clothing lining, light bags |
| Light  | `light_leather`  | deer, goat hide           | soft armor, packs           |
| Sturdy | `sturdy_leather` | wolf, boar hide           | light armor, straps         |
| Heavy  | `heavy_leather`  | elk hide                  | armor, harness              |
| Thick  | `thick_leather`  | bear pelt                 | best armor, prestige trim   |

Cross-links: §1 bark → tannin and planks → buckets; §2 ash → curing; §C salt
competes between food and hides — intentional early tension.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase A — Survival & deterioration core (data + engine)

- `types.ts`: add `thirst`/`hygiene` to `pawn.needs`; `Thirsty`/`Drinking`/
  `Washing` states; `drink`/`wash` zone designation types; building fields
  (`storageDecayMultiplier`, `requiresEnclosure`, `minFuelHeat`, `fluxPerBatch`,
  `moldRequired`); item fields (`durabilityLossPerAction`, `deteriorationRate`).
- `items.jsonc`: retype loose stone to the 5 rock ids (small forage yields);
  `salt`, `salted_meat`, `dried_meat`, `cured_<hide>`, `rotten_hide`, `water`,
  `water_urn`, `ash`, `animal_fat`, `torch`, `candle`. Set perishable
  `decaySeconds`; set tool `durability`/`durabilityLossPerAction` (stone fragile).
- `buildings.jsonc`: Hearth, Butcher's block, **Drying Rack**, Hide Rack, Well,
  traps, storage buildings, `roof`/`door`/`window` build tiles.
- `resources.jsonc`: `halite` (mountains), peat in bog/mud deposits, coal seams.
- Services: container/enclosure **zeroes** elemental `deterioration` (durables);
  organics still spoil via the scaled `decaySeconds` path; **work-usage durability
  decay** in `WorkService` (spend tool durability per action; break at 0);
  thirst/hygiene accrual (**meals restore thirst**); `Washing` state + pawn
  routing to `drink`/`wash` zones; trap capture roll; shared `isEnclosed(tile)`
  (walls + roof + door); crafting-light penalty reads LightingService.

### Phase B — Wood, fuel & ceramics (data)

- `items.jsonc`: 5 log + 5 plank, `green_firewood`/`dry_firewood`, `sawdust`,
  `charcoal`, `peat`, `coal`, `clay_mold`, `tile_mold`, `clay_roof_tile`,
  `fired_brick`, `saw`.
- `buildings.jsonc`: Chopping Block, Sawtable, Charcoal Pit, Pottery Kiln (+ fuel/
  heat/mold fields).
- Engine: **wood-drying** tick (green → dry when within 2 tiles of a fire, not
  adjacent); fuel `minFuelHeat` gating in `BuildingService`.

### Phase C — Stone, metal & leather (data + services)

- `items.jsonc`: 5 block/tile, ore-mineral raws, base-metal + alloy bars, 5
  leather grades, tanning bucket.
- `buildings.jsonc`: Mason's Bench, Stone Forge, Bloomery, Anvil, Tanning Rack.
- `resources.jsonc`: replace `tree` with 5 species nodes; replace generic
  copper/iron/tin ore with named mineral nodes; add quarry yields to walls.
- `BuildingService`: forge fuel + flux + **mold consumption/wear**.
- `resourceGeneratorService`: distribute species/rock/ore/halite/peat/coal across
  biome spawn tables (copper common; tin/iron rarer; gold rare; coal in seams).
- `WorkService`: smelting/casting/sawing/masonry/curing/tanning reuse existing
  work categories — no new work types (trapping resets reuse `hunting`).

## Open Questions

- [ ] Tool wear granularity: per-action decrement (chosen) vs. chance-to-break?
      (lean: deterministic decrement so stone clearly lasts ~8 uses.)
- [ ] Wood drying: track a per-stack `dryness` 0–100, or a simple green→dry flip
      after N turns near fire? (lean: dryness value so partial seasoning reads.)
- [ ] Casting molds: reusable-with-wear (chosen) or single-use? One generic ingot
      mold + per-item molds for tools/weapons?
- [ ] Clay roof tiles: `tile_mold` cast at the forge/bloomery, clay pressed and
      fired at the Pottery Kiln (chosen) — confirm the firing station (kiln vs.
      bloomery heat) and whether the tile mold is metal (cast) or fired clay.
- [ ] Crafting-light penalty curve, and does it block *all* work or only fine work
      (smithing, fletching, tailoring)? (lean: fine work only; hauling unaffected.)
- [ ] Roof rendering: transparent overhead layer that still casts shade + blocks/
      alters light (roofed interior darker by day). Coordinate with LightingService
      so roof shadow is both gameplay input and visible effect.
- [ ] Migration: retype `surface_stone`/`wood_log` in saves, or new-game-only?
      (lean: new-game-only — hot-reloads anyway and there's no proper save yet.)
- [ ] Direct fire-adjacency fire-spread risk — confirm it lands in Living World,
      not here.
- [ ] Can forges overheat / explode? (deferred — hazard system, Phase 3.)
