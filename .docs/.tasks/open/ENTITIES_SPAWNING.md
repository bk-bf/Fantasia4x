# ENTITY SPAWNING (Mobs, Animals, Taming & Husbandry)

> **Related:** [ROADMAP](ROADMAP.md) · [COMBAT-SYSTEM](COMBAT-SYSTEM.md) · [PRODUCTION-CHAIN-EXPANSION](../archive/PRODUCTION-CHAIN-EXPANSION-2026-06-12.md) ([x] archived) · [SOCIAL-LAYER](SOCIAL-LAYER.md) · [LIVING-WORLD](LIVING-WORLD.md) · [game/DESIGN](../../game/DESIGN.md) · [game/ARCHITECTURE](../../game/ARCHITECTURE.md)

## Status

**Phases A and A.5 complete.** `Mob` type, `EntityService`, `Creatures.ts`, rendering, click/hover HUD cards, ENTITIES tab, hunger/diet/starvation/eatProgress — all done.
Phases B–E not started. Two entity classes share a spawn
model: hostile mobs (threat) and neutral animals (food/taming/mounts).

---

## Entity Classes

| Class              | Disposition               | Phases                                                                      |
| ------------------ | ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Hostile mob**    | Attacks pawns; may steal  | Phase A–E (combat blocker)                                                  |
| **Neutral animal** | Flees; huntable; tameable | Phase A (spawn/flee), B (hunt/butcher), C (tame), D (husbandry), E (riding) |

Both use the same `Mob` type and FSM infrastructure. Class is determined by
`behaviour` field and `tameable` flag on `CreatureDefinition`.

| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Base spawns per day     | 1–3 (scales with colony size milestone) |
| Night weight multiplier | ×2–4 (from `ambientLight`)              |
| Spawn edge buffer       | 8 tiles from map edge                   |
| Max active entities     | 40 hard cap (20 hostile / 20 neutral)   |

## Entity FSM (shared)

### Hostile mob states

1. **Wander** — random tile drift 0–2 tiles/turn, new target every 5–10 turns
2. **Alerted** — pawn in `visionRange`; move toward nearest pawn
3. **Attacking** — adjacent to pawn; trigger combat (COMBAT-SYSTEM)
4. **Fleeing** — HP < 20%; move away from all pawns

### Neutral animal states

1. **Grazing** — slow drift within home range (10-tile radius); like Wander
2. **Startled** — pawn within `visionRange`; freeze 1 turn then transition to Fleeing
3. **Fleeing** — sprint away from threat at +1 tile/turn bonus
4. **Exhausted** — after 20 turns of Fleeing; slows to normal speed (huntable)
5. **Tamed** (persistent) — follows assigned pawn; no longer flees; see Phase C
6. **Foraging** (Phase A.5) — herbivore/omnivore moving toward a grass tile to eat
7. **Hunting** (Phase A.5) — carnivore/omnivore pursuing nearest non-tamed animal or Corpse

FSM transitions for neutral animals:

- Grazing → Startled: pawn within `visionRange`
- Startled → Fleeing: any move or attack
- Fleeing → Grazing: no pawn in `visionRange × 1.5` for 15 turns
- Fleeing → Exhausted: 20 turns in Fleeing state
- Any → Tamed: taming action succeeds (Phase C)
- Any → Foraging: `hunger >= 60` AND not threatened AND `diet` is herbivore/omnivore
- Any → Hunting: `hunger >= 60` AND not threatened AND `diet` is carnivore/omnivore
- Foraging/Hunting → previous state: `hunger <= 10` (sated)

---

## Phase A.5 — Entity Hunger & Diet

> Prerequisite for Phases B (hunting) and D (husbandry). Can be implemented
> independently of combat. Adds a simulation heartbeat to the entity layer.

### Data model

Entities reuse the same `EntityNeeds`, `EntityCondition[]`, and `EntityStats` types as
pawns — no dumbed-down duplicates. Abilities are **never** computed for entities.

```typescript
// Fields added to Mob (implemented in types.ts)
interface Mob {
  needs: EntityNeeds; // same type as Pawn.needs; sleep fields set to defaults
  conditions?: EntityCondition[]; // progressive conditions (malnutrition, wounds, etc.)
  stats: EntityStats; // mapped from CreatureDefinition.stats at spawn
  eatProgress?: number; // 0–1 progress through current eat action
  huntTargetId?: string; // id of target Mob when in Hunting state
}

// EntityStats mapping from CreatureDefinition.stats:
// strength     → strength   (direct)
// speed        → dexterity  (×1.5 rounded)
// visionRange  → wisdom     (perception)
// health       → constitution (10 + (health - 30) / 5)
// entityClass  → intelligence (animal=4, mob=8)
// charisma     = 5 (default)
```

The shared condition helper `conditionNeedMultipliers()` lives in
`core/needs.ts` — used by both `PawnService` and `EntityService`.

### Hunger accrual

| Diet      | Base rate (×SECONDS_PER_TICK) | Notes                   |
| --------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| herbivore | 0.5 / s                       | slow — always near food |
| carnivore | 1.0 / s                       | faster — must hunt      |
| omnivore  | 0.7 / s                       | middle ground           |

Condition stage multipliers from `EntityCondition[]` are applied on top via
`conditionNeedMultipliers()` (shared with `PawnService`).

Starvation (`hunger >= 100`): entity loses 1 HP / second until it eats or dies.

### Feeding mechanics

**Herbivore / omnivore — Foraging state:**

1. Entity transitions to `Foraging` when `hunger >= 60` and not threatened.
2. Pathfinds toward nearest tile with `resources.grass > 0` within 15-tile radius.
3. On arrival: plays `eatProgress` 0 → 1 over 5 ticks. Consumes 1 `grass` from tile.
4. On completion: `hunger -= 40`; back to `Grazing`/`Wander`.
5. If no grass found within radius: wanders toward map-center home range.

**Carnivore / omnivore — Hunting state:**

1. Entity transitions to `Hunting` when `hunger >= 60` and not threatened.
2. Targets: nearest `Corpse` first (free food); else nearest non-Tamed `animal`.
3. Pursues target via same `moveToward` as Alerted state; sets `huntTargetId`.
4. Adjacent to Corpse: begins `eatProgress` 0 → 1 over 8 ticks; then `hunger -= 50`.
5. Adjacent to live animal: triggers a mini-combat roll (STR vs STR); on kill —
   entity enters step 4 on the resulting Corpse.
6. If target dies/decays before arrival: clear `huntTargetId`, re-evaluate.

### Progress bar rendering

When `eatProgress > 0`, `GameCanvas` should render a progress bar overlay on the
entity tile (same `worldEffects` pipeline used for pawn tasks). The existing
`SelectedEntityCard.progressBar` field surfaces it in the HUD info card too.

### Relationship to pawn hunger

Entities deliberately do **not** call `calculatePawnAbilities()` — that system
is pawn-only. They share the **type** layer (`EntityNeeds`, `EntityCondition[]`,
`EntityStats`) and the condition-multiplier helper, but skip abilities entirely.

### Entity vs Pawn systems — intentional boundaries

| System     | Pawns                          | Entities                                    |
| ---------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| Health     | `pawn.state.health` + ModSys   | `mob.health` / `mob.maxHealth` (simple HP)  |
| Stats      | Race traits + ModifierSystem   | `mob.stats: EntityStats` (no modifier calc) |
| Needs      | `EntityNeeds` (hunger/fatigue) | **Shared** `EntityNeeds` type — same fields |
| Conditions | `EntityCondition[]`            | **Shared** `EntityCondition[]` type         |
| Abilities  | calculatePawnAbilities()       | **Not called** for entities                 |
| FSM        | `PawnState` + job queue        | `MobState` autonomous                       |
| Movement   | PathfindingService (WASM)      | EntityService simple `moveToward`           |
| Rendering  | `pawnRenderPos` smooth interp  | `mobRenderPos` smooth interp (fixed)        |

---

## Phase B — Hunting & Butchering

### Hunting work category

Pawn with `hunting` job designation pursues the nearest non-tamed `animal`
entity using the WASM pathfinder. Attack resolved with existing weapon stats
minus a range penalty for moving targets.

| Property       | Value                                                 |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Primary stat   | Dexterity                                             |
| Secondary stat | Perception                                            |
| Required tool  | Any weapon (ranged preferred for +20% hit on Fleeing) |
| Skill gain     | `hunting` skill (separate from `combat`)              |

Hit chance while target is Fleeing: `(dex - 10) × 2 + weaponAccuracy - 20`.
Hit chance while target is Exhausted or Grazing: no penalty.

On kill: entity health → 0, entity state → `Corpse`. Corpse tile-entity persists
for 200 turns before degrading to nothing (losing all loot).

### Butchering work category

Pawn walks to Corpse tile, performs `butchering` job.

| Property       | Value                                                     |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Primary stat   | Strength                                                  |
| Tool bonus     | Butcher's Cleaver (Tier 1 tool, Stone Forge) → +50% yield |
| Work amount    | `creature.stats.health × 0.3` turns                       |
| Building bonus | Butcher's Block building → +1 quality yield tier          |

Yield is drawn from `lootTable`. Without cleaver: 60% of listed qty. With
cleaver: 100%. Butcher's Block: 100% + bonus bone/fat chance.

---

## Phase C — Taming

Pawn with `taming` job approaches target animal carrying an acceptable food
item in inventory. Taming chance per turn:

```
chance = (pawn.empathy + pawn.skills.taming × 2) / 100
        × foodQualityMod
        × creature.tameResistance  // 1.0 = easy, 0.3 = hard
```

Food quality mods: raw_meat × 0.8, cooked_meat × 1.2, preferred_food × 1.5
(per creature definition). Taming consumes 1 food item per attempt.

Taming fails immediately if pawn attacks while animal is not Exhausted.
Recommend: weaken first (combat), then tame while Exhausted.

On success: entity gains state `Tamed`, assigned to pawn, added to
`GameState.tamedAnimals[]` with owner pawnId.

---

## Phase D — Husbandry

Tamed animals require a **Pasture** building (fenced area, 4×4 minimum).
Animals assigned to a pasture consume `grass` or `feed` each day.

| Animal            | Product   | Interval             |
| ----------------- | --------- | -------------------- |
| Mountain Goat     | `milk` ×2 | 300 turns (1 day)    |
| Wild Chicken      | `egg` ×1  | 200 turns            |
| Any breeding pair | offspring | 3000 turns (10 days) |

Pasture capacity: 1 animal per 4 pasture tiles.
Breeding requires one male + one female of the same species in the same pasture.
Offspring are unassigned tamed animals.

New `milk` and `egg` items feed into the cooking chain (cooking service).

---

## Phase E — Riding

Tamed `mountable` animals can be assigned as a mount to a pawn.

```typescript
interface Pawn {
  // ...existing...
  mountId: string | null; // TamedAnimal id
}
```

While mounted:

- Movement speed: pawn speed + mount.speed (not added — takes higher value + 1)
- Can cross `shallow_water` without penalty
- Melee attack range extends to 2 (charge reach)
- New ability: **Mounted Charge** — move 3 tiles in a line, attack at end with +30% damage; costs 4 AP

Mount can be injured in combat (takes hits separately from pawn). Injured mount
slows to base pawn speed until healed (vet work category, Phase E2 — deferred).

### Mount roster (Phase 1)

| id         | Name     | Speed | Terrain bonus       | Notes                                  |
| ---------- | -------- | ----- | ------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `elk`      | Elk      | +2    | forest (no penalty) | available Tier 1 if tamed              |
| `warhorse` | Warhorse | +3    | open terrain        | Tier 2; bred from wild horse (Phase 2) |

---

## Implementation Plan

### Phase A — Shared entity layer [x] DONE

- ~~Add `Mob` interface to `core/types.ts` (id, creatureId, x, y, health, state, entityClass)~~
- ~~Add `mobs: Mob[]`, `tamedAnimals: TamedAnimal[]` to `GameState`~~
- ~~Add `core/Creatures.ts` with all hostile + neutral definitions~~
- ~~`EntityService` singleton (renamed from `MobService`): `spawnEntities()`, `stepEntities()`, `removeDead()`~~
- ~~Rendering: draw all `mobs[]` via existing glyph pipeline in `GameCanvas.svelte`~~
- ~~Click-to-select mob with locked HUD info card~~
- ~~Hover mob shows dim HUD info card (parity with pawns)~~
- ~~ENTITIES tab (F9) listing live mobs with focus-on-map~~

### Phase A.5 — Entity Hunger & Diet [x] DONE

- ~~Add `EntityService.stepHunger(state)` — accrues `mob.hunger` each tick; triggers `Foraging`/`Hunting` FSM transitions~~
- ~~Herbivore foraging: pathfind to nearest grass tile, consume via `eatProgress` timer~~
- ~~Carnivore hunting: pursue nearest `Corpse` or live animal via existing `moveToward`; mini-combat roll on contact~~
- ~~Starvation damage: `hunger >= 100` → −1 HP / tick~~
- ~~Render `eatProgress` as world-effect progress bar overlay (reuse pawn task bar pipeline)~~

### Phase B — Hunting & Butchering

- [x] Add `hunting`, `butchery` work categories to `core/Work.ts` (note: id is `butchery`, not `butchering`)
- [ ] Pawn hunting: `JobService` / `WorkService` — pathfind pawn to nearest non-tamed animal, attack roll on arrival
- [x] Corpse tile-entity: dead mobs remain in `mobs[]` with `state: 'Corpse'`; `diedAt` + `CORPSE_DECAY_TICKS` already in `EntityService` (no separate `Corpse[]` array needed)
- [x] Add `bone_cleaver` (Tier 1 butchery tool, `makers_bench`) — crafted from `large_bones` + flint + cordage; +25% carcass yield
- [x] Add `dressing_stone` (Tier 1 butchery building) — flat stone slab + log stakes; unlocks at tool tier 1; +25% carcass yield stacks with `bone_cleaver`

### Phase C — Taming

- Add `taming` work category
- `EntityService.attemptTame(pawnId, entityId, state)` — chance roll per turn
- Promote entity to `TamedAnimal` on success

### Phase D — Husbandry

- Add `Pasture` to `core/Buildings.ts`; tile capacity rule
- Add `husbandry` work category (collect milk/eggs, assign breeding)
- Daily product generation in `EntityService.stepHusbandry(state)`

### Phase E — Riding

- Add `mountId` to `Pawn` (nullable)
- Modifier: `ModifierSystem` checks `pawn.mountId` for movement/combat bonuses
- Add `Mounted Charge` to `core/Abilities.ts`

## Open Questions

- [ ] Do tamed animals persist across saves? (yes — serialise `tamedAnimals[]`)
- [ ] Can mobs attack buildings? (deferred — Phase 2)
- [ ] Mob-vs-animal combat? (wolf eats deer — deferred, emergent fun)
- [ ] Vet work category for healing injured mounts? (Phase E2 — deferred)
- [ ] Magic-tamed creatures (shadow familiar, etc.)? (Phase 3)
