# AUDIT

Master checklist of system audits. Driven via headless sim (`./dev.sh --headless` → `/api/sim/*`; dev verbs in `sim/commands.ts`). Tick a box only when a headless run confirms it. ⚠ = known defect. `T0–3` = toolTier. `⚙` = passive station.

Audit only what's implemented. An unrealistic simplification that doesn't match the rest of the game is either a misunderstanding (raise it) or deliberate (track *why* here) — never just pass it.

## Done (this session)

- [x] Headless sim end-to-end — session/tick/command/state/query/save/load/trace verified live over curl
- [x] Creature AI sweep (map full of mobs, monitored logs)
  - [x] Pathfinding — no stuck/oscillating pathing under Node
  - [x] Needs/hunger driving FSM correctly
  - [x] ⚠→fixed: sated predators froze (Wander↔Hunting flip) — opp-hunt vs sated-exit contradiction; gated opp-hunt on hunger. See [BUGS](../../game/BUGS.md)
  - [x] Dev-spawned hunters auto-assigned a nearby lair
- [x] Headless crafting made usable + swept: crafting works end-to-end (queue→fetch→walk→craft→output). Fixes landed while driving it:
  - [x] `buildScenario` now auto-designates a stockpile (shipped a zero-tile zone → crafts silently stalled)
  - [x] `devToggleDecay {kind:'deterioration'|'spoilage'}` — freeze weather wear (buildings+items) / food+carcass spoilage so dev-spawned stuff survives a test
  - [x] Root finding: `getRecipeForItem` = first-producer-wins → 25 recipes sharing an output are unreachable via the card. **18 butchery ones FIXED** (see Butchery); **7 non-butchery remain** (see below)

## Crafting & building

### Known defects (repro headless → fix)
- [x] ⚠→fixed: Lower-tier station disappeared when higher tier built. Root cause was UI-only — `craftLanes` (CraftingScreen) only surfaced station types already hosting an order, so once auto-assign funnelled everything to the workbench the craft_spot got no droppable lane and was unreachable. The service already supports it (`stationFulfills` true for craft_spot↔craft_spot, `moveCraftOrder` re-pins, `craft.ts` runs one order per physical station in parallel). Fix: `craftLanes` now shows a lane for **every** complete station that can host a queued recipe, including idle lower/alternate tiers. Auto-assign still prefers the top tier (`bestCraftStation` unchanged).
- [x] ⚠→fixed: Fermentation ignored temperature. Added `fermentTempRate(temp)` (EnvironmentService, two-sided window: dormant ≤4°C, full 15–28°C, killed ≥40°C — mirrors the drying gate but with an upper bound); `processPassiveProduction` now scales the fermenter's passive work by the station tile's temp, stalling when too cold/hot. Data-driven via `effects.fermentation` on the fermenter (brewing_barrel brines unaffected).
- [x] ⚠→fixed: Onion-on-grass tile not cleared. `plant.ts complete()` now clears occupants by resource count **or** a live growth entry, so a regrowing grass_patch (count 0, growth>0) is stripped and the tile renders dirt→crop correctly. Count-0 patches strip with no drops (no extra rng draw → determinism preserved).
- [x] ⚠→fixed: `make_hide_arrow_sheath` now uses `cured_light_hide` (was the sourceless generic `hide`). Audit of all `hide` inputs: this was the only broken one — the other `hide` uses are `acceptsCategory:"hide"` dynamic slots on rawhide products (raw_hide_vest, rawhide_round_shield), which correctly use raw hide by design.
- [x] ⚠→fixed: `ferment_mead` removed (beekeeping deferred). Replaced with `ferment_cider` (apples → cider) — a `cider` drink item brewable from existing apples at the fermenter. Mead item → cider; honey/fermenter text de-referenced.
- [x] ⚠→fixed: `dressing_stone` was dead (no recipes + `butcheryYieldBonus` read by zero code). Gave butchery stations their own tier ladder (`effects.butcheryTier` 0/1/2/3, separate from the generic tier) so any butchery station renders lower-tier butcher_spot recipes; wired `butcheryYieldBonus` into `craft.ts` so the ACTUAL station's bonus multiplies meat/hide/bone (dressing_stone +25%, flensing/altar +45%). Verified: small_bones 4→5 at a dressing stone.
- [x] ⚠→fixed: `make_firestarter` removed (deprecated recipe + commented-out item both deleted).
- [x] ⚠→fixed: low-work outliers rebalanced — `make_woven_basket` workAmount 2→10, `make_wicker_vest` 5→12 (proportionate to snapsack 8 / gambeson 12 given their material cost).

### Recipes craftable + sane materials (every recipe, grouped by station)

**Swept via headless (`_auditSweep`): 326/334 targets queue (real `craftItem` gating + reservation + carcass dispatch) AND produce correct outputs (`completeCraftOrder`) in a fully-provisioned colony (all research, tool tier 3, every station built, deterioration frozen). Butchery tested per-carcass. Only failures = the 8 shadowed non-butchery duplicates below.** Pawn fetch/walk/craft pipeline verified separately for representatives (cordage etc.); fuel/lighting for passive furnaces is pawn-driven and not exercised per-recipe here.

### Stations & navigation
- [x] Recipe blocked when required station absent (canQueueCraft station gate); pawn navigates to station tile to craft (verified headless for representatives — cordage etc.)
- [x] Tier coexistence: craft_spot stays a droppable lane after makers_bench/carpenter_bench exist (fixed — see Known defects)
- [x] Higher tier preferred when unpinned (`bestCraftStation`); `craftingBonusOf` feeds workRequired (speed)
- [ ] Specialised (non-tiered) stations never superseded; passive⚙ stations process with no pawn; fuel stations refuse cold; `maxCount` enforced

### Weapons
- **Combat verified headless** (`_weaponsAudit`, 5/5). Two headless facts had to be understood first: attack cadence ≈ 133 ticks (`BASE_ATTACK_INTERVAL_TICKS 120` / attackSpeed, `TICKS_PER_SECOND 60`) so fights need HUNDREDS of ticks; and the sim starts at NIGHT (`ambientLight 0.15`) so mobs don't self-aggro (vision-gated) — an explicit draft attack order drives the fight regardless. New lever added: `devSpawnMobAt {creatureId,x,y}`.
- [x] Melee equips `mainHand` + deals damage of the weapon's type (iron_mace → goblin Corpse; `resolveHit` avg 44, type blunt).
- [x] finesse→PER (steel_rapier PER6 avg 10.4 → PER26 avg 43.6), arcane→INT (ember_staff INT6 6.5 → INT26 25.8), AP applied (armor mitigation below). — *exact damMin–damMax band, strScaled numeric, armorDamage/stun/knockback/on-hit conditions, attackSpeed/reach still not asserted*
- [x] Ranged ammo lifecycle: fires only with matching ammo + consumes it (war_bow arrows 8→6); NO phantom shots at 0 ammo (goblin unharmed, holds); WRONG ammo doesn't feed (bolts in a bow untouched, no fire). — *drawPower scaling / crossbow reload / recoverable-retrieval not yet asserted numerically*
- [x] Magic staves: channeled (no ammo), pays `staminaCost` as mana (ember_staff stamina 124→117 per cast)
- [x] Shield equips to `offHand`. 2H + off-hand is ALLOWED (not forbidden) but penalized: ⚠→fixed with the new `fouled_guard` transient condition — granted when a `twoHanded` mainHand shares the hands with an off-hand item, it scales the DERIVED combat values (not base attributes) to 0.5: dodge, hitChance (aim), attackSpeed, weaponDamage, critChance. Verified headless: 2H+shield vs clean 2H → hit 0.67→0.33, dmg 50.1→25.2, crit 0.06→0.03. (Wired via a generalized `Combat.conditionMult(entity, key)`.) `wieldRequirement.strength` still not exercised.

### Gear
- [x] Worn armor mitigates incoming damage (plate_cuirass: `resolveHit` avg 44 → 32.7). — *per-part coverage, layer-stacking, individual slash/crush/pierce resistances, sane-per-piece values not yet asserted individually*
- [ ] Hit on covered part mitigated (no hit-through); uncovered part bypasses; fatigue/movePenalty apply — *needs per-body-part resolveHit control*
- [x] ⚠→fixed: **shields were near-useless** — one flat ×1.25 dodge, tier-independent, with `defense`/`parryChance`/`bashDamage`/`kickDamage` all dead. Rebuilt as a real **block/parry** axis (2nd negation path, distinct from dodge): new `block` stat (CON + body mass, NOT weight-penalized → the heavy tank's negation); shields add `blockBonus` (the tier ladder made real, 0.12→0.34), a `parryChance` (deflect + **immediate guaranteed free counter**), and on-hit **shield-bash** procs (stagger/knockback/knockdown, heavy tiers). Block covers melee + reduced-vs-ranged. Verified headless: no-shield 26/300 negated → iron shield 131/300 (block 124 + parry 7); buckler 79 < iron boss 127; live bash staggers/knocks down. `SHIELD_DODGE_MULT` removed (no more dodge double-dip). Layer 2 (dodge/block build traits) + creature block deferred. — *armorDamage degradation still not asserted*
  - **Shield audit (adversarial, `_shieldAudit`, 6/6):** ✓ block scales with CON (0.41→0.46); ✓ **the key coherence claim** — block stays high under heavy full-plate (0.42) while dodge stays low (0.18), i.e. the tank blocks rather than evades; ✓ block+parry CAPPED (extreme CON40/140kg tank = 0.57 block, 0.60 negated, still eats real hits — `BLOCK_CAP` holds); ✓ bash procs are heavy-shield only (buckler produces no stagger); ✓ tier ladder + parry occurrence (from `_shieldBlock`). Two findings surfaced, **your call** (not fixed):
    - ⚠ **Mobs get ~1.8% innate block** — the `block` stat is CON+mass, and mobs have CON, so every creature now negates ~2% of melee even with no shield. Creature block was deferred (Layer 3). Tiny, but unintended: gate block behind holding a shield, keep it as negligible "bracing", or make innate block pawn-only?
    - [x] ⚠→fixed: **2H + shield freeloaded full shield block/parry.** `fouled_guard` now also halves `block` (`"block": 0.5`, wired through `blockChance` via `conditionMult`), so a two-hander can't strap a shield for free defense. Verified headless: clean shield pawn negates 0.667 of blows → fouled 0.332 (halved). (Parry left intact — a deflect+counter a two-hander can't set up anyway; block was the freeloaded stat.)
- [x] Jewelry grants conditions while worn (ruby_ring → `might` in transientConditions; re-derived each tick, auto-clears on unequip). — *aim gear/quivers → ranged, cold/heat/stealth mods still not asserted*

### Capacity & hauling
- [x] Worn carriers add inventoryBonus to carry budget (wicker_frame: `getCarryBudget` maxWeightKg 16.3→28.3, +12kg). — *back-slot competition not yet asserted*
- [ ] Carts (wheelbarrow/handcart) boost budget + used by haul jobs; quivers add carry+drawspeed
- [ ] Liquid containers track fill/capacity; static storage holds off-budget; carry budget enforced on pickup

### Time-based progression
- [ ] Drying (plant_fiber→hay, meat→dried, wood seasoning) — respects temp (<12°C slow, ≥28 fast) & wetness (soaked reverses); fire-ring faster
- [ ] Fuel depletes per tick, fire dies at empty, cold fire won't process — wet fuel burns worse? raise if inconsistent or track reason
- [x] Fermentation (ale/wine/cider) temp-gated via `fermentTempRate` (dormant <4°C, full 15–28, killed >40); brines stay a plain passive timer
- [ ] Spoilage: food→decaysTo, freezing halts, preservation+roof slow; drying/spoiling mutually exclusive
- [ ] Item deterioration by category every 600 ticks, roof/stored exempts — flat rate, no temp/wetness; raise if unrealistic or track reason
- [ ] Building condition by material×weatherExposure (rain/snow up to 3×), roof shelters; decay buildings need repair

### Crops
- [ ] All 17 crops plantable in soil grow-zone; plant job per eligible tile
- [ ] Tile→empty dirt at plant (clears regrowing grass ⚠); crop glyph only after 20% growth
- [ ] Growth 0→100 gated by temp/moisture/soil/light; 100% yields harvestable; harvest resets tile
- [ ] Soil terraform (lay_poor/loam/rich/terra_preta) changes subterrain + growth rate

### Butchery
- Yield-vs-speed rule (established): butchery stations give a **yield** bonus (better tools → more off a carcass); stations where more-out-than-in makes no sense (tools, smelting ore→ingots, cooking) give **speed** (`craftingBonus`) instead. Fires give more max fuel. Generic stations already give speed; butchery yield now wired.
- [x] Butchery yield bonus wired + tier ladder (`butcheryTier`): dressing_stone/flensing/altar render lower recipes and their `butcheryYieldBonus` (+25/+45%) multiplies output
- [x] ⚠→fixed: great-carcass renders/flenses + humanoid `*_remains` + jackal/quillback/olm were UNREACHABLE (their meat/bones dispatched to a different recipe). Root: butchery dispatched by output meat, and the carcass-card path was dead (`isCarcass` never set → carcass cards never rendered). Fix: `isCarcass` derived from `category==='carcass'` at the item index; orders carry `recipeId`; `craftItem`/`canQueueCraft`/`completeCraftOrder` dispatch butchery by the CARCASS (`resolveCarcassRecipe`, picks the best built station via `butcheryTier`); crafting-screen carcass cards gated on `category` + yields from the recipe. Verified headless: great_wolf→render_great_wolf, goblin→make_goblin_remains, dire_wolf→make_dire_wolf @flensing_table.
- [~] ⚠ NON-butchery shadows: **`tan_*_leather_bucket` (×5) RESOLVED** (Tanning redesign — rack removed, buckets are the only path, one `tan_<leather>` per species). Still open: `smelt_blast_steel` → Steel rework (both steel recipes replaced); `grind_mana_crystal` → Crystal/magic-reagent rework (redesign, not prune); `make_ash` → unshadow (Ash economy section).
- [ ] Gating: needs knife/butchery tool; T2 needs tier 2 — below-tier pawn blocked
- [ ] Spoiled carcass yields proportionally less (conditionMult)
- [ ] butcher_spot T0 — all common game: make_{rabbit,venison,wolf,bear,boar,elk,goat,chicken,rat,aurochs,mammoth,owlbear,sabretooth,crocodile,hippogriff,hoarfowl,worg,jackal,quillback,olm}_meat, harvest_thornwood_silk
- [ ] butcher_spot T0 — humanoid remains (bones/sinew only): make_{goblin,kobold,gnoll,orc,harpy,bullywug,stirge,viper}_remains; make_salted_meat
- [ ] butcher_spot T1 — boss render: render_great_{wolf,bear,boar,weaver}
- [ ] flensing_table T2: make_{dire_wolf,cave_bear,direboar,broodmother}
- [ ] sanguinary_altar T2 — full flense (rare organs): flense_great_{wolf,bear,boar,weaver}
- [ ] ~220 creatures have NO butchery recipe — list spawnable un-butcherable carcasses; decide add/generic/none

### Pawn skill effects
- [ ] Skill speeds craft (getWorkModifiers) & raises output quality (itemQuality §Q)
- [ ] Butchery skill raises yield; recipe→discipline routing correct (craftDiscipline)
- [ ] Zero-skill pawn still completes T0 (no bootstrap deadlock); tool-tier gates only where intended
- [ ] Quality matters downstream (better weapon/armor/tool stats into combat/work)

## Material & production reworks (PROPOSED — track only, not implemented)

> These supersede the "shadowed recipe" ⚠ notes above (lines: tanning_bucket_station, blast_furnace,
> the 7-shadowed list): the shadows were masking that whole CHAINS need reworking, not just
> de-duplicating. The shadow-bug's own fix = **option 1, prune the loser** — but for tanning & steel
> the prune is absorbed into the reworks below (the "losing" recipes are being replaced, not just cut).

### Tanning chain redesign + hide/leather variety split — ✅ COMPLETE (re-audited headless 2026-07-23)
Reference: VilesMods "Hell-Bent for Leather" (mandatory tanning step, per-animal leathers) + Hardcore SK.

> **Re-audit (`_leatherChainAudit`, adversarial, 9/9, real recipeService/itemService/completeCraftOrder):**
> ✓ the 6 abstract tiers + felt/coarse/fine wool are gone as items; ✓ 17 leathers (all `category:leather`)
> + 5 wools (`category:wool`) + `jackal_hide` exist; ✓ every leather has exactly ONE tan recipe (no
> shadowing), each passive + consuming brine; ✓ every cured hide has ONE passive cure recipe at the Curing
> Frame with ash/salt; ✓ `tanning_rack`/`card_wool`/`comb_fine_wool`/`make_felt`/`cure_beast_hide` removed,
> `weave_woolcloth` takes `category:wool`; ✓ all 7 fletched-ammo recipes feather-gated; ✓ wool butchery
> drops wired (rabbit/goat/aurochs/mammoth); ✓ **material flow** — a jerkin crafted from mammoth_leather
> stamps matDur 1.3 / matWeight 1.35 vs coney_fur 0.8 / 0.75 (heavier, tougher item from the heavier hide).
>
> **⚠→fixed during the re-audit — finished armour satisfied a material slot.** Armour uses `category` as
> its armour CLASS (leather/metal/cloth/organic), so a finished `boiled_leather_jerkin` is `category:leather`
> — and once 52 inputs became `category:leather`, `itemMatchesCostCategory` let a jerkin be consumed as raw
> leather. The collision spans every class (leather 19 mat + 16 gear; metal 16 + 22; cloth 1 + 3; organic
> 29 + 3). Fixed at the chokepoint: `itemMatchesCostCategory` (+ the RecipeService copy) now excludes
> `type` armor/weapon/tool, so a cost/slot only ever draws raw stock. Verified: `category:leather` →
> the 19 leather MATERIALS (17 + boiled_leather + scale_plate), no armour.

**Current chain (3 stages):** raw pelt/hide → **cure** (passive, `hide_rack` "Curing Frame", +ash×2 or
salt×1) → **tan** (TWO competing paths: active `tanning_rack` +bark, OR passive `tanning_bucket_station`
fuelled by `tanning_brine`) → **harden** (`tanning_rack`, beast_leather + water → boiled_leather). Brine
brewed passively at `brewing_barrel` (bark+salt+ash+water). ⚠ Bucket recipes take NO material input —
brine is consumed only as station FUEL (`defaultAllowedFuelItemIds`), so it's "cured hide → leather for free".

**Decided direction — IMPLEMENTED (2026-07-23; `pnpm check` clean, 0 new dangling refs, recipe/craft tests green):**
- [x] **Removed `tanning_rack` entirely** (building + its 5 `make_*_leather` recipes). Tanning is now only the passive bucket stations.
- [x] **Relocated `harden_boiled_leather`** → `beast_tanning_bucket` (passive): a stiff leather (`boarhide`/`oxhide`) + water → `boiled_leather`.
- [x] **Bucket tanning consumes brine as a LISTED input** (`tanning_brine`/`beast_brine`), and the buckets' brine-as-fuel config was stripped (they're plain passive stations like the Curing Frame). Closes the "free leather" hole and gives `brew_*_brine` real consumers.
- [x] **Curing kept passive** at the Curing Frame (two-step chain: cure → tan).
- [x] `make_ash` reachability unchanged (still a hearth recipe; see Ash section).

**Hide/leather split** — no more collapsing distinct animals into one leather. Today wolf/boar/worg → one
"sturdy" leather; elk/aurochs → one "heavy"; and jackal literally drops `wolf_hide`. Proposed: each hide
tans to its OWN leather, differentiated along axes **suppleness↔stiffness · insulation · armor · durability
· weight · beauty/value** — so downstream recipes pick the leather whose identity fits (supple buckskin →
light garments; stiff oxhide/boarhide → boiled cuirass & shields; warm bearhide/wolf → winter cloaks;
sabretooth/direwolf → prestige).

| mire_crocodile | croc_scaled_hide | crocodile_scale (`scale_plate`) | rigid scutes · low insul · v.high armor · own line, NOT "leather" |

- [x] **17 per-animal leathers IMPLEMENTED** (the table above, minus croc scale which stays `scale_plate`). Each `category:leather` with graded `material.item` (durability/weight → crafted item) + `material.building` (insulation/comfort/beauty → furniture). The 6 abstract tiers (thin/light/sturdy/heavy/thick/beast_leather) removed.
- [x] Fixed `jackal` dropping `wolf_hide` → new `jackal_hide` item → `jackal_leather`.
- [x] **Cure-stage shape decided: per-species cured intermediate** (17 `cured_*` items, all `category:cured_hide`; 17 passive cure recipes) — the two-step passive process the user wanted. Downstream `category:cured_hide` consumers (`hide_bed`, `boil_hide_glue`, arrow sheath) accept any cured hide.
- [x] **Downstream NOT hard-gated by leather type** (user decision): 52 hard tier-leather inputs → `category:leather` (any leather works); 11 stale variant blocks stripped. "Wrong" leather still crafts, but its `material.item` multipliers flow to the output — **durability AND weight**, surfaced as `Durability ×N` / `Weight ×N` rows in the craft tooltip (mirrors the building/stone tooltip). Per-instance weight subsystem built: `matWeight` stamped at craft (like `matDur`) → carried onto the `ItemInstance` → applied against `def.weightKg` in `getCurrentCarryLoad`, so a piece from a heavier hide is heavier to carry. Determinism byte-identical.
- [x] **`Recipe.materialBonuses` removed** (was display-only dead code — a "cosmetic lie" never stamped on the item; type + `applyMaterialBonuses` + tooltip path + 15 data blocks all deleted).

### Wool sourcing & furniture materials
**Current:** only `mountain_goat` + `woolly_mammoth` carcasses drop `coarse_wool`; NO shearing (ANIMAL-HUSBANDRY
Phase D wants a `sheep` + live-shear — still open). Wool ladder exists at `weaving_frame`
(`coarse_wool`→`wool`→`fine_wool`→`woolcloth`, + `felt`). Wool items ALREADY carry a `material.building`
comfort/insulation block (wired as a furniture material) — the hook is in place.

**Decided direction — IMPLEMENTED (2026-07-23). Scope kept deliberately smaller than leather (user call): 5 source-graded fleeces, no fur/pelt-down second axis, no refine ladder.**
- [x] **5 source wools**, tiered by how hard the animal is to take (replaces the generic `coarse_wool`/`wool`/`fine_wool`): `coney_wool` (rabbit, trivial), `goat_wool` (goat, easy), `sheep_fleece` (sheep, husbandry-pending), `ox_wool` (aurochs, dangerous), `mammoth_wool` (mammoth, apex). All `category:wool`; identity via `material.building` comfort/insulation + `material.item` durability (coarse ox = bulk warmth/low comfort; fine coney/mammoth = comfort).
- [x] **Butchery drops wired**: `make_goat_meat` coarse_wool→goat_wool; `make_mammoth_meat` coarse_wool→mammoth_wool; added `coney_wool` to `make_rabbit_meat`, `ox_wool` to `make_aurochs_meat`. sheep_fleece has no butchery drop (arrives with ANIMAL-HUSBANDRY live-shear; item + ladder ready).
- [x] **No refine ladder**: grading is at the source, so `card_wool`/`comb_fine_wool` removed; `weave_woolcloth` now takes `category:wool`×3 (any fleece → cloth, finer fleece = better cloth via multiplier). `spin_thread`/`regal_robes`/`enchant_thread`/`stargazer_circlet` re-gated to `category:wool`.
- [x] **`felt` removed** (dead-end material — nothing consumed it); its bedding/padding role is filled by raw wool directly (each fleece carries `material.building` comfort/insulation).
- [ ] Furniture re-gate (mid beds/seating built from wool, leather only for top) — deferred to the furniture/comfort-system section (not part of this pass).
- [ ] Cross-link ANIMAL-HUSBANDRY live-shear (sheep_fleece source) — still open.

### Feathers → fletched ammo (added this pass)
- [x] The 7 fletched-ammo recipes (`make_{flint,bone,iron,broadhead,barbed}_arrow`, `make_{iron_bolt,heavy_quarrel}`) now require `feathers` (with `chicken_feathers` as an alternative), gating ranged ammo behind hunting fowl (chicken/hoarfowl/hippogriff). Feather items left `category:organic` (not recategorised, to avoid flipping their trade/scavenge behaviour).

### Steel chain — realism rework + specific steel types
**Current recipes are metallurgically INVERTED.** `make_steel_bar` (finery_forge: iron_bar+coal+limestone
→ steel) — the real finery forge DECARBURIZES pig iron INTO wrought iron; it never made steel.
`smelt_blast_steel` (blast_furnace: iron_bar → steel×3) — a real blast furnace consumes ORE → **pig iron**,
not bars → steel. `iron_bar` from the bloomery ≈ wrought iron already (a fine base). Goal: replace generic
"steel" with a **carbon-content + process-provenance material FAMILY** — differs deliberately from
RimWorld/HSK's single upgraded ingot: here steel is NOT a tier, each type is use-locked with orthogonal
hardness/toughness tradeoffs (the historical difficulty of hitting the ~0.2–2.1% carbon window is the tension).

**Bases (non-steel):** `pig_iron` (blast furnace, brittle high-C, castable only), `iron_bar` = wrought iron
(bloomery / finery-decarbed pig iron; soft/tough/weldable; cementation feedstock).

**Full family (6)** — decided scope:

| Steel | Process / station | Hard | Tough | Cost | Use-lock |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `bloom_steel` | bloomery + carburize (primitive) | med | med | low | early weapons/tools |
| `blister_steel` | cementation furnace (passive; wrought iron + charcoal, long bake) | med-hi | med | med | tools, heads, springs |
| `shear_steel` | forge-fold blister at anvil | high | med-hi | med-hi | quality blades/edge tools |
| `crucible_steel` *(exists)* | crucible steelworks (sealed melt) | v.high | med (brittle untempered) | high | premium blades, razors, fine tools |
| `pattern_welded` | anvil forge-weld (wrought iron + high-C steel) | high | high | v.high (labour) | legendary swords |
| `mild_steel` | puddling / Bessemer at blast tier (bulk) | low-med | high | low per-unit, high tech gate | plate armour, structural, mass tools |

- [ ] Replace `make_steel_bar` + `smelt_blast_steel` with the ore → pig_iron → wrought → steel chain above.
- [ ] Add stations: `cementation_furnace` (blister), a puddling/bessemer step (mild). `crucible_steelworks` exists.
- [ ] Differentiate downstream: blades request crucible/pattern_welded/shear; plate requests mild; springs
      request blister; cast goods request pig_iron; fittings request wrought iron.
- [ ] Add each steel's material stats (hardness → armour-pen/edge, toughness → shatter resistance) to items.
- [ ] This replaces the blast-vs-finery shadow entirely — no prune needed, both current recipes are wrong.

### Crystal / magic-reagent chain — rework (make it as intricate as steel)

**AUDIT — crystal types that exist, sources, sinks** (all minable crystals come from `crystal_formation`
subterrain veins + dig sites; deplete, no regrowth; cluster in the mountain interior):

| Item(s) | category / affinity | Mined from | Sinks (uses) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| mundane gems: ruby, sapphire, emerald, topaz, amethyst, citrine, moonstone | `crystal` | Ruby/Sapphire/…Crystals nodes | `cut_*` → jewelry (rings/amulets/crowns/pendants); cut ruby/sapphire/topaz → element staves |
| infused gems: infused_ruby…infused_moonstone | `magic_crystal` | occasional (0–1) from the same nodes + star_geode / amethyst node | `attune_*` → `attuned_*` → jewelry + T2 staves; **grind_gem_dust → gem_dust×2** |
| `mana_crystal` | `magic_crystal` / arcane | `mana_crystal_vent`, `buried_hoard` | ⚠ ONLY `grind_mana_crystal` → gem_dust×4 (SHADOWED = dead). Minable but effectively useless. |
| `star_shard` | `magic_crystal` / arcane | `star_geode`, `sunken_relic` | exactly ONE sink: `make_stargazer_circlet` |
| `voidshard` | `magic_crystal` / necrotic | `voidshard_cluster`, `sunken_relic` | ⚠ ZERO sinks — item desc says "awaiting its (blocked) recipes". Fully dead. |
| `arcane_resin` | `magic_crystal` | crafted (resin + gem_dust), not mined | ⚠ ZERO consumers — produced, never used. Dead-ended. |
| `gem_dust` | reagent | grind_gem_dust / grind_mana_crystal | the FUNNEL: ~13 recipes (arcane_robe, magic_concrete, arcane_resin, all potions/draughts/elixirs/tonics, magic_alloy_bar, enchant_thread, runed_block) |

**Finding — same anti-pattern as generic steel.** `mana_crystal` is NOT a deprecated duplicate (own vent +
lore); the real problem is that ALL crystal variety collapses into one generic **`gem_dust`** that feeds
everything undifferentiated. Elemental/affinity identity EXISTS on the inputs (ruby=fire/ember, sapphire=
frost/rime, topaz=lightning/spark; mana=arcane, void=necrotic) but is WASHED OUT at the dust step. star_shard
(1 use), voidshard (0), arcane_resin (0) are stubs.

**Decided direction — a real multi-stage, affinity-differentiated chain (parallel to the 6-steel family):**
- [ ] **Differentiate the dust by element/affinity** so downstream items require the MATCHING crystal, not
      generic dust (use-lock, like steel): ember_dust (ruby)→fire gear, rime_dust (sapphire)→frost, spark_dust
      (topaz)→lightning, arcane_dust (mana_crystal)→neutral/high enchant. Kills the identity-washout hole.
- [ ] **Give `mana_crystal` a distinct high-grade role** (arcane — the pure/neutral top reagent: strongest
      enchants / a mana-charge system / base for magic_alloy) instead of "×4 gem dust". Unshadows it AND makes
      mining its vent worthwhile. (This resolves the grind_mana_crystal shadow by REDESIGN, not prune.)
- [ ] **Wire up `voidshard`** (necrotic — the cursed/dark path: high power + a deliberate downside) — currently dead.
- [ ] **Expand `star_shard`** beyond the single circlet (celestial/arcane enchant line).
- [ ] **Give `arcane_resin` consumers** (produced but used nowhere) — or prune it.
- [ ] Multi-stage refinement matching steel's depth: raw crystal → cut/refined → attuned/charged → alloyed/inscribed.

### Ash economy — producers, sinks, and the make_ash decision

**AUDIT:**
- Producers: `make_ash` (hearth **primitive:1**, dedicated: green/dry firewood or branches → ash),
  `burn_charcoal` (charcoal_pit **primitive:2**, byproduct alongside charcoal), `make_coke` (charcoal_pit
  primitive:2, byproduct).
- Consumers: **curing** (hide_rack primitive:2, ash×2–4 per hide — the big early sink, but every cure has a
  `salt` alternative), `brew_tanning_brine`/`brew_beast_brine` (brewing_barrel, ash×1–2), `make_soap`
  (alchemy_lab, ash×2, basic_alchemy-gated). Salt (the ash alt) comes from mined `rock_salt`.

**Q1 — worth grinding ash BEFORE charcoal? Finding: yes, in a real window.** The main sink (curing) is
primitive:2, same tier as the charcoal_pit — but the pit's ash is a *byproduct of making charcoal*, and
charcoal isn't needed until iron smelting (bloomery iron:1, much later). So a primitive leatherworking colony
has no reason to build a charcoal_pit yet; `make_ash` at the hearth (primitive:1) is their only practical ash
source — unless they have mined salt (the cure alternative). **So keep `make_ash` reachable** — it earns its
place for a no-salt primitive path.
- [ ] Unshadow `make_ash` (per-recipe card or list-order) so the hearth ash path is reachable.

**Q2 — should ash be a byproduct of fires in general (realistic)?** Today only the charcoal_pit emits
byproduct ash; cooking/baking/kiln/smelting fires emit none. Universal fire-ash is realistic BUT floods supply
— current sinks can't absorb a baking-heavy colony's output, so ash becomes a waste-management resource.
**Decision required, must be DELIBERATE:**
- [ ] EITHER expand ash sinks FIRST (real ones: potash → `fertiliser` at the compost_bin; lye → soap/leaching;
      ash-glaze for pottery; concrete/mortar filler) so universal ash byproduct is absorbed,
- [ ] OR treat ash-as-waste intentionally (a disposal/compost loop) — realistic, but only if designed on purpose.
- [ ] Until one is chosen, do NOT sprinkle ash byproducts onto fire recipes (avoids an unmanaged waste leak).

## Furniture → pawn systems (comfort / relaxation / socialisation) — AUDIT + proposal

- [x] AUDITED (three code sweeps) — findings below. Nothing implemented yet. Headline: **most of the target
      system is already scaffolded** — this is EXTEND-and-rewire, not build-from-scratch.

**EXISTS today:**
- Beds are the only interactive furniture. 5 tiers (`sleeping_spot`→`hay_bed`→`hide_bed`→`leather_bed`→
  `feather_bed`) carry `sleepQuality`/`fatigueRecovery` → measurably faster rest vs the ground (0.58/s). So
  **"bedroom furniture gives rest-speed bonuses" is ALREADY DONE.** (Only `feather_bed` also carries `comfort` 0.4.)
- A `relaxation` NEED already exists (needs.jsonc; inverted 0–100, decay 0.13/s) + a `Socialising` FSM state —
  the exact template for a new comfort meter + relax state.
- Socialising is satisfied at **gathering buildings** (`buildingProperties.gathering` = campfire + hearth only,
  radius 3), NOT at tables/chairs.
- `comfort` exists only as a building/material **amenity number** (radius 2), feeding 3 small ambient bonuses:
  sleep speed, wound-heal speed, mood lift (cap +3). Chairs/stools/tables/couches emit comfort+beauty but are
  **never sat on or pathed to** — pure scenery.
- Condition plumbing already supports the target: `intoxicated` is a positive-style TIERED, timed,
  severity-decaying condition (the template for a tiered `comfortable`); conditions can slow fatigue
  (`fatigueRate < 1`, e.g. `sheltered` 0.9) and boost mood (`"mood": "cond_*"` → mood.jsonc).

**MISSING (the work to track):**
- [ ] **`comfort` pawn meter/need** — model on `relaxation` (decay block in `processNeedsTick`, kill-switch,
      `moodBands`, `case 'comfort'` in `computeMoodTarget`). Fed by the comfort of furniture the pawn sits on/near.
      ⚠ NAME COLLISION: temperature "comfort band" (cold/heat exposure, `comfortRange`) already exists — keep the
      furniture meter distinct in naming/docs so the two axes don't merge.
- [ ] **Tables/chairs as socialisation anchors** — today only fires. Give dining/gathering furniture
      `gathering: true` (or a new anchor flag) so pawns gather at a table, not just the hearth.
- [ ] **New "sit & relax at table" state** — clone the Socialising path (`tryRouteToSocialise` →
      `handleMovingToNeed` → `handleSocialising`): pawn paths to a chair around a table, sits, fills
      relaxation/comfort. Register the state in **needs.jsonc `states`** (not states.jsonc — the split
      `stateRegistry.test.ts` enforces) + add to `STATE_HANDLERS`.
- [ ] **Chair tiers → comfort** — map each seat/couch tier's `comfort` value into the comfort-meter fill rate
      (better chair = more comfort per sit).
- [ ] **Tiered `comfortable` condition** — model on `intoxicated`: stages (e.g. content → comfy → cosy →
      pampered), each `fatigueRate < 1` (slows tiring) + `"mood": "cond_comfortable"` (mood boost). Granted at
      high comfort, decays when the pawn leaves comfortable surroundings. Add `cond_comfortable` tiers to mood.jsonc.
- [ ] **Bed tier → rested/comfort link** — sleeping in a good bed should feed the comfort meter / grant a
      "well-rested" buff (no positive rested/well_rested condition exists today).
- [ ] (optional) **positive `cond_socialised`** — a timed mood lift after socialising (today social only clears
      the negative `restless`/`starved_company` bands, no positive thought).
- [ ] **Validate the intended loop end-to-end:** kill woolly animals → wool → better beds/chairs → comfort
      meter ↑ → `comfortable` (slower fatigue + mood ↑) → higher productivity.
