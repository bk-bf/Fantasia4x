Refactors resource harvesting to use item-based workTypes

Redesigns the work system to determine harvestable resources through item workTypes instead of static mappings. This change:

- Adds workTypes property to items to specify which work categories can produce them
- Removes static WORK_TO_RESOURCE_MAPPING in favor of dynamic resource lookup
- Updates work processing to support multiple possible resources per work type
- Improves resource discovery by checking item workTypes against available locations

This makes the system more flexible and maintainable by centralizing resource-work relationships in item definitions rather than hard-coded mappings.
